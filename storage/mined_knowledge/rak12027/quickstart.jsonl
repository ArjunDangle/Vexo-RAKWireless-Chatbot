RAK12027 uses I2C communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict, especially on some IO modules.  \nAfter all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.  \n> **WARNING:** - Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.\n- Only 3.7-4.2V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.\n- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.\n- Only 5V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.\n- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base Board. Not all batteries have the same wiring."}
