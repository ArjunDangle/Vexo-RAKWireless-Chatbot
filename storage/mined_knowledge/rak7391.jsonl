The following table shows the CPU features:\n\n| Feature               | Description                       |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| CPU                   | Broadcom BCM2711                  |\n| Architecture          | ARMv8 Cortex-A72 64 bits     |\n| CPU core count        | 4                                 |\n| CPU nominal frequency | 1.5 GHz                      |\n| Operating system      | RAK Pi OS                         |\n| RAM                   | 1, 2, 4, or 8 GB DDR4        |\n| Storage               | 8, 16, or 32 eMMC (Optional) |\n\n##### PSU Input\n\nYou can choose between three main power supply solutions:\n\n- 2.1 x 5.5 mm DC input, center positive, 10-28 V<sub>DC</sub>\n- Phoenix terminal input, 10-28 V<sub>DC</sub>\n- Active IEEE 802.3at or IEEE 802.3bt on 1 GbE connector\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nYou can only use one of the previous power supply ways at the same time.\n\n\nThe exact current required from the +12 V PSU is dependent on the application and what is connected to the RAK7391. It is recommended to budget 25 W for the CM4.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, it can provide 5 V<sub>out</sub>. If you want to supply 12 V<sub>out</sub> from the different PSU connectors on the board, you have to use PoE to feed the board with 12 V<sub>DCin</sub>.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThe 12 V<sub>DCout</sub> connectors in the board are directly connected to the power supply. Use only 12 V<sub>DC</sub> adapters when powering 12 V devices from the board.\n\n\n##### Full-Sized HDMI 2.0 Connector\n\nThe CM4 handles most of the interfacing for the HDMI interface, with most signals directly connected to the CM4. The current for the HDMI interface is limited to 500 mA.\n\n##### Ethernet\n\nThe RAK7391 features two Ethernet ports: one 1 Gb port that supports PoE and one 2.5 Gb port that does not support PoE. To enable the PoE function, the RAK PoE module must be installed.\n\nThe CM4 module includes a built-in 1 Gb Ethernet interface. For high-speed network requirements, the 2.5 Gb Ethernet port can be utilized. This 2.5 Gb Ethernet port connects to the PCI bus, which is shared with other components such as USB 3.0, Mini PCIe slot #3, and the M.2 slot. The actual maximum speed depends on CPU usage and the other peripherals connected to the board. Under normal usage and without modifying the CM4 configuration, speeds of 1.8–2.0 Gbps can typically be achieved.\n\n##### PoE HAT\n\nIf you want to use the PoE function of RAK7391, you need to have the RAK PoE module. The RAK7391 has an onboard PoE Hat interface. The PoE module supports both 802.3AT and 802.3BT standards to meet the different needs. The PoE input voltage ranges from 42 V to 57 V. AT module max output is 12 V 2.5 A (30 W), and BT max output is 12 V 6 A (72 W).\n\n##### USB 2.0 Hub\n\nThe RAK7391 board includes two (2) onboard USB 2.0 hubs, which expand a single USB 2.0 port from the CM4 into seven (7) ports:  \n\n- One port is available on the USB 2.0 connector on the board.  \n- Two ports are connected to mPCIe slots #1 and #2.  \n- Two ports are connected to the WisBlock slots.  \n- The remaining two ports are converted to UART and connected to the WisBlock interfaces.  \n\nThere is an internal current limit switch to provide VBUS to the USB connectors. The current limit is set to approximately 500 mA.\n\n##### USB 3.0 Hub\n\nThe RAK7391 board features an onboard PCIe to USB 3.0 hub that provides four (4) USB 3.0 interfaces:  \n\n- Two are connected to the USB 3.0 connectors on the board.  \n- One is connected to mPCIe slot #3.  \n- One is connected to the M.2 interface.  \n\nNote that the PCIe line is shared with the 2.5 Gb Ethernet port, as well as with modules connected to mPCIe slot #3 and the M.2 slot.\n\nThere is an internal current limit switch to provide VBUS to the USB connectors. The current limit is set to approximately 1 A.\n\n##### USB Type-C Connector\n\nThe Type-C connector is used to flash the eMMC on CM4 non-lite versions via `rpiboot`. When a Type-C cable is connected, the USB 2.0 hub is automatically disabled, and the CM4 functions as a USB device.\n\nYou have two options to upload an image to the CM4 module. One way is to add a jumper to the eMMC Flash pair in the configuration header and power the board. The other way is to press the Flash Mode button while powering on the board, after powering on, you can release the button.\n\n##### Micro SD Card Socket\n\nThe micro SD Card socket is a **PUSH-PUSH** socket. To release the micro SD Card a gentle push on the micro SD card will enable it to be removed. This socket is only used with CM4 Lite modules that do not have an onboard eMMC.\n\n##### Fan Connector\n\nThis connector supports standard fans with PWM drive and tachometer output. The fan is controlled via I2C using an EMC2301 driver. It is compatible with both 5 V and 12 V fans, selectable through an optional jumper cap.\n\nIf you only have a 2-wire fan, you can also use it by connecting it to the 5 V-GND connectors.\n\n##### DSI Display Connectors (22 Pin 0.5 mm Pitch Cable)\n\nThe DSI 4-channel interface is routed to separate 22-way 0.5 mm pitch connectors, identical to those on the CMIO board but different from the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. To use a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B display, an adapter board will be required.\n\n##### Dual CSI-2 Display Connectors (22 Pin 0.5 mm Pitch Cable)\n\nBoth CSI-2 interfaces (2-channel and 4-channel) are routed to separate 22-way 0.5 mm pitch connectors. These connectors are the same as those on the CMIO board but differ from the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. To use a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B camera, an adapter board is required.\n\n##### Raspberry Pi HAT Connector\n\nThe RAK7391 has a standard Raspberry Pi 40-way HAT connector. Mounting holes are also provided so that a standard HAT can be secured in place.\n\n##### Real-Time Clock\n\nThe RAK7391 has a PCF85063AT RTC onboard. A battery socket is provided for a CR2032 battery. On initial setup, the **CLKOUT** of the RTC should be disabled to save power. The alarm output of the RTC is used to wake up the CM4 from a previous halt mode. If an alarm goes off during normal operation the CM4 will be reset, this can be used as a watchdog timer if required.\n\n#### Pin Definitions\n\n##### Jumpers\n\nThe J39 header can be optionally used to set some specific configurations:\n\n| Pin   | Name       | Function                                                                                             |\n|-------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1-2   | eMMC Flash | If installed, it forces USB booting. This feature is used to flash a new image onto the eMMC memory. |\n| 3-4   | EEPROM_nWP | If installed, it enables write protection for the EEPROM on the CM4.                                 |\n| 5-6   | WiFi OFF   | If installed, it disables the Wi-Fi functionality.                                                   |\n| 7-8   | BT OFF     | If installed, it disables the Bluetooth functionality.                                               |\n| 9-10  | Wake up    | Allows wakeup or reset functionality using the onboard RTC.                                          |\n| 11-12 | Buzzer ON  | If installed, the buzzer is enabled.                                                                 |\n\n##### CM4 IO Voltage Selection\n\nBy default, the RAK7391 board sets the CM4 IO voltage to +3.3 V through R11. To change the IO voltage to +1.8 V, move R11 to the R12 position.\n\n##### I2C\n\nGPIO2 and GPIO3 are used for the I2C interface (i2c1) and are connected to onboard I2C devices as well as external I2C interfaces (WisBlock, Raspberry Pi HAT, mPCIe slots). If an external I2C device conflicts with the address of an onboard I2C device, the external I2C bus can be reassigned by making the following changes:  \n\n1. Move the 0 Ω resistors from R718 and R719 to R716 and R717.  \n2. Increase the values of R720 and R721 to 4.7 kΩ.  \n3. Remove R722 and R723.  \n\nAfter these modifications, external I2C devices will be controlled via i2c3 (GPIO4 and GPIO5), while internal devices (RTC, ADC, GPIO Expanders) will remain on i2c1.\n\nTo use the ID_SC and ID_SD signals on the Raspberry Pi HAT, remove R711 and R712.\n\n**I2C default addresses**\n\n| Device             | Part      | Default Address |\n|--------------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| OLED Screen        | SSD1306   | 0x3C            |\n| GPIO Expander #1   | TPT29555  | 0x27            |\n| GPIO Expander #2   | TPT29555  | 0x26            |\n| ADC                | SGM58031  | 0x4B            |\n| FAN Controller     | EMC2301   | 0x2F            |\n| Temperature Sensor | SHTC3     | 0x70            |\n| Real-Time Clock    | PCF85063A | 0x51            |\n| Secure IC          | ATECC608A | 0x60            |\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThe address of certain onboard devices can be changed by adjusting the resistor configuration.\n\n\n##### ADC\n\nIf the I2C address of the ADC chip on the board conflicts with another I2C device, you can resolve the conflict by removing R648 and connecting it to one of R647, R649, or R650 to change the address. The available addresses are (default one in bold):\n\n| Resistor | ADC Address        |\n|----------|--------------------|\n| R650     | 1001000 (0x48)     |\n| R647     | 1001001 (0x49)     |\n| R649     | 1001010 (0x4A)     |\n| **R648** | **1001011 (0x4B)** |\n\n##### GPIO Expander\n\nYou can change the GPIO expander address by modifying the resistor if there is an address conflict.
