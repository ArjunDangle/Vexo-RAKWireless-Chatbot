When the module restarts, the frame counter resets to zero, which ChirpStack may interpret as a replay attack. While disabling this feature is safe for testing, ensure it is enabled in production. Note that in RAK11160, the frame counter resets upon reboot.  \n> **Image:** Configure a device in the ChirpStack console  \n2. After selecting the ABP mode, the following parameters will appear under the **ACTIVATION** tab:\n- **Device Address**\n- **Network Session Key**\n- **Application Session Key**  \n> **Image:** ChirpStack ABP activation parameters  \n3. The parameters can be generated as random numbers by the platform or can be set with user values. Once these parameters are filled in properly, the process is completed by clicking on the **ACTIVATE DEVICE** button.\n4. After registering the RAK11160 in ChirpStack as an ABP device, create a [custom firmware using Arduino IDE for RAK11160](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisduo/rak11160-module/quickstart/#uploading-abp-lorawan-example-to-rak11160) or use [ABP AT Commands](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisduo/rak11160-module/quickstart/#abp-configuration-for-ttn-via-wistoolbox-console) with external MCU host."}
