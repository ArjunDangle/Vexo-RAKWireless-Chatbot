For example, if the router has assigned IP 192.168.0.125, allow the DMZ on that IP. It is recommended to change the default password of the gateway when DMZ is allowed for security reasons, as the gateway is exposed to the Internet.  \nIn using Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS), you can assign a domain name that you have linked to your gateway’s dynamic IP address. This allows you to access your gateway with a domain name that is static. It will also not change even if a new IP address is assigned to the gateway making sure they don’t have to keep a list of addresses that needs to be constantly updated.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\nIn this example, `afraid.org` DDNS provider will be used.  \n1. First, create an account in a DDNS service provider like [freedns.afraid.org](https://freedns.afraid.org/) or other. Go to the site, click on the **Sign up Free** button and follow the registration instructions.  \n> **Image:** Making an account  \n> **TIP:** NOTE  \nActivate the accounts from the link sent in their e-mail.  \n2.

Those that have sent no data for more than 10 min are discarded from the count.\n- **Busy Nodes**: Shows the number of busy nodes within the LoRaWAN gateway's coverage (Nodes with an average message spacing of less than 100s.).\n- **Duty Cycle of the LoRa Channel**: The graph represents the Duty Cycle load by frequency channel (Data is kept for the last 12 hours). The minimum resolution along the time axis is 100s. Each value is an average of over 100s. The values are color code – green to red, low to high.\n- **RSSI & SNR**: These graphs show how many of the total amount packets have an RSSI/SNR value within a certain range.

The user can change that name to his desire.  \nTo protect their AP, you can choose between three encryption types.
