For example, if the router has assigned IP 192.168.0.125, allow the DMZ on that IP. It is recommended to change the default password of the gateway when DMZ is allowed for security reasons, as the gateway is exposed to the Internet.\n\n\nIn using Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS), you can assign a domain name that you have linked to your gateway’s dynamic IP address. This allows you to access your gateway with a domain name that is static. It will also not change even if a new IP address is assigned to the gateway making sure they don’t have to keep a list of addresses that needs to be constantly updated. \n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nIn this example, `afraid.org` DDNS provider will be used.\n\n\n1. First, create an account in a DDNS service provider like [freedns.afraid.org](https://freedns.afraid.org/) or other. Go to the site, click on the **Sign up Free** button and follow the registration instructions.\n\n> **Image:** Making an account\n\n           \n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n\nActivate the accounts from the link sent in their e-mail.\n\n\n2. After successful registration and activation, log in and navigate to the **Subdomains** menu.\n\n> **Image:** Subdomains menu\n\n3. Proceed by clicking on **Add a subdomain**. \n\n> **Image:** Adding a subdomain\n\nIn the **Add a new subdomain** menu, you must type the following information:\n\n- **Type** – The type of the subdomain. More information about each type can be found in the **explanation** button (in this example, it will be left as default).\n- **Subdomain** – The name of the subdomain.\n- **Domain** – From the drop-down menu, choose a preferred domain (in this example, it will be left as default). \n- **Destination** – The dynamic IP of the gateway.\n- **TTL** (only for premium accounts) - A value for the period of time that a packet or data should exist on a computer or network before being discarded.\n- **Enable/disable Wildcard** – More information about the Wildcard can be found in the button **more info.**\n\n4. After filling in all the required information, type the verification image in the field and click on **Save!**. You will be redirected to the page of registered subdomains.\n\n> **Image:** List of Registered Subdomains\n\n5. To configure the gateway, the user needs to navigate to **Services -> Dynamic DNS (Beta)** tab in the Web UI. In the **Overview** menu, they should type a name for the configuration and click on the **Add** button. \n\n> **Image:** Adding a DDNS Configuration\n\n6. This will redirect them to the configuration menu.\n\n> **Image:** Configuration Menu\n\n7. First, you must enable the service by click on the **Enable** button in the **Basic Settings**. Then fill in the required information:\n\n- **Lookup Hostname** – The hostname of the DDNS provider (in this example – afraid.org).\n- **IP address version** – The version of the IP address (in this example, it will be left as default).\n- **DDNS Service provider [IPv4/IPv6]** – From the drop-down menu, then choose which DDNS provider you are using (in this example – afraid.org-basicauth).\n- **Hostname/Domain** – Fill in the subdomain name.\n- **Username** – The name used to register the DDNS account.\n- **Password** – The password of the DDNS account.\n\n7. In the **Advanced Settings** tab, you can configure the details for the selected Dynamic DNS. \n\n8. Configure also the gateway to check its IP. To do this, from the drop-down **IP address source [IPv4/IPv6]** menu, you need to choose **URL**. The gateway will fill in the **URL to detect [IPv4/IPv6]** field automatically. Change the link to another desirable page that reads the gateway’s IP, but it is not necessary. The IP assigned to the gateway is read and sent to the DDNS provider. \n\n9. In the **Event Network** **[IPv4/IPv6]** drop-down menu, choose the Network in which the DDNS-updater scripts will be started.\n\nThe other fields are optional and will be left as default. The **Log to syslog** drop-down menu selects the level of the system logs. The **Log to file** button will allow syslogs to be saved in a file on the gateway’s SD card. \n\n> **Image:** Advanced Settings Tab\n\n10.  In the **Timer Settings** tab, you can configure the details for the timer to check for changes of IP and errors.\n\n> **Image:** Timer Settings Tab\n\n- **Check Interval** – The interval to check if there is a change of the IP for the gateway.\n- **Force Interval** – The interval to force updates to be sent to the DDNS provider.\n- **Error Retry Counter** – How many errors are allowed to occur before the script stops.\n- **Error Retry Interval** – The interval after which the script will start running again after an error.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nFor this example, Timer Settings will be left as default.\n\n\n11.  In the **Log File Viewer** tab, you can view the system logs, and it is helpful in the case of debugging. To see the logs, click on **Read / Reread log file.**\n\n> **Image:** Log File Viewer Tab\n\n12.  To save the settings, click **Save & Apply.**\n\n13.  If everything is configured correctly, the user will be able to access the gateway via the name of the subdomain in the list of the added subdomains in the DDNS provider.\n\n> **Image:** Name of the Subdomain\n\n> **Image:** Accessing the Gateway via the Domain Name\n\n","keywords":["DDNS","Dynamic DNS","WisgateOS","Configuration"],"source_file":"software-apis-and-libraries\\wisgateos\\configuring-ddns.md","token_count":0}

Here are displayed not only messages from devices connected to the gateway directly but from any device that is within the coverage of the gateway and transmitting LoRa messages.\n- **Transmitted**: Shows the total number of downlink LoRa messages sent by the gateway.\n- **Active Nodes**: Shows the number of active LoRa nodes within the LoRaWAN gateway's coverage. Those that have sent no data for more than 10 min are discarded from the count. \n- **Busy Nodes**: Shows the number of busy nodes within the LoRaWAN gateway's coverage (Nodes with an average message spacing of less than 100s.).\n- **Duty Cycle of the LoRa Channel**: The graph represents the Duty Cycle load by frequency channel (Data is kept for the last 12 hours). The minimum resolution along the time axis is 100s. Each value is an average of over 100s. The values are color code – green to red, low to high.\n- **RSSI & SNR**: These graphs show how many of the total amount packets have an RSSI/SNR value within a certain range. This is also shown in a pie chart to the side of the graphs.\n- **Uplink Traffic**: The field shows the packet per minute rate as a function of time and airtime(s) per minute as a function of time. Above the graphs, you can see the color-coding of the different Spreading Factors, where the actual height of the values is a sum of all the packets overall spreading factors for the time sample.\n- **Downlink Traffic**: Shows the packet per minute rate as a function of time and airtime(s) per minute as a function of time. Above the graphs, you can see the color-coding of the different Spreading Factors, where the actual height of the values is a sum of all the packets overall spreading factors for the time sample.\n- **System**: Shows some basic information about the gateway such as hostname, model, serial number, firmware version, local time, uptime of the gateway, load average, and GPS location.\n- **Memory**: There are bars in this section that show how much is the Total Memory Available, Free and Buffered Memory is. \n- **LoRa Network Server**: You can see the statistics for your network server. The number of associated LoRa Nodes, Uplink, Downlink, Received Join, and Rejected Join, those types of packets all have a numerical value associated with them. Additionally, you can check the Uptime and whether you have the MQTT Integration running.\n- **Network**: Shows parameters and status for IPv4 network interface that is active in the gateway. Some of the parameters are Type, Interface IP, Netmask, Gateway, DNS1, DNS2, etc.\n- **Cellular**: This shows the connection status of the gateway’s cellular together with the corresponding Network ID and the parameters of the Sim card (ICCID, IMSI, Phone number). (*optional*)\n- **Wireless**: Shows parameters and status for the Wi-Fi. Some of the parameters are connectivity status, signal strength, and IP addressing parameters for both AP and Client interfaces.\n- **Dynamic DNS**: The field shows the Dynamic DNS configuration if configured, otherwise, there will be a message saying **There is no service configured.**\n\n#### LoRaWAN Packet Logger\n\nThis is where a log of the LoRa messages is shown in real-time. There are several options for filtering as well as the possibility to download the statistics in a file. There is also a message summary: Total, Uplink, and Downlink.\n\nBy selecting a particular packet (by a single click on the packet), you get an extended window with the detailed metadata for the packet as well as some RF parameters. In addition, there is a graph area below the packets list, where is shown the **Air Time** for each of the nodes that have packets detected by the packet logger and also the load per frequency channel.\n\n> **Image:** LoRaWAN Packet Logger Page\n\nFilter the packets by choosing any of the following:\n\n- **Type**: Filter the packets by type. By default, all the types of packets are shown. When a certain type is selected, the logger will show only this type of packet and the others will be ignored. The possible options are the following:\n    - Join Request\n    - Join Accept\n    - Unconfirmed Data Up\n    - Unconfirmed Data Down\n    - Confirmed Data Up\n    - Confirmed Data Down\n- **DevAddr**: Filter the packets by the node address. Only packets from the selected node will show in the logger and the others will be ignored.\n- **Hide CRC_ERR packet**: When it is selected, no **CRC** check error message will be displayed.\n\n#### System Log\n\nOn this page, you can see the complete system logs. It is useful mainly for debugging purposes. The System Log reports both system information and actual data from LoRa frames coming from the end nodes. \n\n> **Image:** System Log Page\n\nOn the top right corner, you can find the button there:\n\n- **AUTO REFRESH ON/OFF**: Depending on the state (ON or OFF), the auto-refresh will be on or off.\n\n#### Firewall\n\nThis section shows only information about traffic on different ports, addresses, etc. It is organized in tables; however, there are no configuration options here, and this is only for observation. There is a dedicated sub-section for the Firewall Settings in the Network section, where you can actually configure rather than only observe. The only actions you can perform here are to **Reset Counters** or **Restart Firewall** via the links on the top left.\n\n> **Image:** Firewall Page\n\n### Network\n\n#### Ethernet Port\n\nThis page allows you to set up the **Ethernet Port Type**. The options are WAN and LAN, and they can be selected via the dropdown menu.\n\n> **Image:** Ethernet Port Page\n\n#### WAN Interface\n\nThe first element of this page is the **Status** field where you (*the user*) can check statistics about the gateway, such as the Uptime, MAC-Address, TX, RX, and IPv4 Address. You can also configure the protocol to be used for connecting to the network. \n\n> **Image:** WAN Interface Page\n\nThere are 2 options for the protocol:\n\n- **Static address**: Allows you to put a static address that will be used by the gateway.\n- **DHCP client**: The gateway will use the address that the router assigns to it.\n\nWhen **Static address** is selected, other settings that can be done: \n\n> **Image:** WAN Interface with Static Address Page\n\n**IPv4 address**: The network address in Internet Protocol version 4.\n\n**IPv4 netmask**: The subnet mask in Internet Protocol version 4.\n\n**IPv4 gateway**: The address that will be assigned to the Gateway in Internet Protocol version 4.\n\n**Use custom DNS servers**: Flipping the DNS switch allows you to enter a custom DNS server address.\n\n**IPv6 assignment length**: You can assign a part of given length of every public IPv6-prefix to this interface.\n\n**IPv6 address**: The network address in Internet Protocol version 6.\n\n**IPv6 gateway**: The address that will be assigned to the gateway in Internet Protocol 6. \n\n**IPv6 routed prefix**: A public prefix routed to this device for distribution to clients.\n\n**Override MTU**: You can set the Gateway MTU size (1500 standard).\n\n### Cellular Interface\n\nThis page is where you can make changes on the Cellular connectivity. \n\n> **Image:** Cellular Interface Page\n\n- **Status**: This shows the **Uptime**, **MAC-Address**, **RX** (received packets), and **TX** (sent packets).\n- **LTE network is enabled**: A button that enables/disables the interface. \n- **Enable IPv6**: Enables the Internet Protocol version 6 for the Cellular interface.\n- **APN**: The Access Point Name of the SIM provider (filled if needed).\n- **User**: Username used for authorization. \n- **Password**: Password for authorization.\n- **PIN Code**: The PIN code of the SIM Card (filled if needed).\n\n#### Wi-Fi\n\nThis page is where you can make changes in the Wireless connection.

The results are conveniently displayed in a CLI box.\n\n> **Image:** Diagnostics Page\n\n#### Firewall\n\nThe Firewall settings won’t be discussed in detail in this document due to the large variety of settings to be configured. This document will give a simple overview of the interface instead.\n\nThe Firewall page has a few separated tabs:\n\n- **General Settings**: This tab has two fields. The first field is the **General Settings** tab where general settings can be done: **Enable/Disable SYN-flood protection**, **Drop invalid packets on/off**, and **Input/Output/Forward settings**. The second field is for Zones settings where you can set up separate settings for the zones.\n\n> **Image:** General Settings Tab\n\n- **Port Forwards**: This tab allows you to set up the port forwards. Port forwarding allows remote computers on the Internet to connect to a specific computer or service within the private LAN. In the tab, there is a register with the port forwards that are already set up, and below is a couple of fields to set up a new port forward. \n\n> **Image:** Port Forwards Tab\n\n- **Traffic Rules**: This tab allows you to set up the traffic rules. Traffic rules define policies for packets traveling between different zones, for example, to reject traffic between certain hosts or to open WAN ports on the router. \n\n> **Image:** Traffic Rules Tab\n\n- **Custom Rules**: This tab allows you to execute arbitrary iptables commands which are not otherwise covered by the firewall framework. The rules that will be written is interpreted as a shell script.\n\n> **Image:** Custom Rules Tab\n\n#### Multi WAN\n\nIn the Multi WAN menu, you can can set a priority for all the interfaces. If highest priority WAN source goes down, other in line will be used to access Internet. In the WAN Source Status, it shows which interface is available.\n\n> **Image:** Multi WAN Tab\n\n### Channel Plan\n\nIn the Channel Plan, you can set up the operating frequency of the gateway. These frequency channels are the ones that the gateway will use to both receiving and transmitting from/to LoRa nodes. The first field on the page is for the **Region** that the gateway is set to. You can also change the region, corresponding to the frequency band for their country. The other modifications that can be done are **LoRaWAN Public** (on/off), **Multi-SF LoRa Channel**, **Standard Lora Channel**, and **FSK Channel**.\n\n> **Image:** Channel Plan Page\n\nThere is also the button **Conform to LoRaWAN** that when turned off, it will give you a possibility to set up a Radio Configuration for each concentrator.\n\n> **Image:** Switch to Advanced Mode Tab\n\n### LoRa Network\n\n#### Network Settings\n\nHere, the working mode of the gateway is set up. In the **LoRaWAN Network Settings** field, you can find the **Gateway EUI** and set the **Mode** (Packet Forwarder, Basics Station, and Network Server) and **Log Level** (Error, Warning, Notice, Info, and Debug). Depending on the chosen mode, the set of available settings change. \n\n##### Packet Forwarder\n\n- **General Setup**: All the needed variables for configuration are as follows:\n  - **Protocol**: You can choose what protocol will be used by the gateway.\n  - **Server Address**: The URL of the LoRa Server (in the example: the EU TTN address).\n  - **Server Port Up/Down**: These are the ports of the LoRa Server that are going to be used for inbound and outbound traffic.\n  - **Push Timeout (ms)**: The time delay for the server response after sending uplink data.\n  - **Statistic Interval (s)**: The time interval of how often statistics are pushed to the server.\n  - **Keepalive Interval (s)**: the interval of which the gateway send data to make sure that the server is aware that the gateway is online. For example, the MQTT bridge will unsubscribe from the topics after a certain period of inactivity.\n  - **Automatic data recovery**: A feature that allows LoRa frames to be stored on the SD card (provided there is one in the slot). If the gateway loses connection to the LoRa Network Server, upon restoring the connection, the buffered messages will be forwarded, so no data is lost. This is done in blocks of 8 (FIFO) until all are cleared from the buffer.\n  - **DGRAM MTU**: The size of the maximum transmission unit. Default is 1400.\n  - **Auto-restart Threshold**: This variable defines how many times the Keepalive Interval can expire before the Packet Forwarder restarts.\n  - **Is LoRaWAN Network**: When NO is chosen, frames that are not compliant with the LoRaWAN specification will be forwarded (in case of a proprietary LoRa Server solution).

The default name is **RAKXXXX_YYYY**, where **XXXX** is the model of the gateway (e.g. 7249), and **YYYY** are the last symbols of the MAC address of the gateway. The user can change that name to his desire. \n\nTo protect their AP, you can choose between three encryption types. In the drop-down menu in the **Encryption** field, you can choose any of the following options: **WPA-PSK**, **WPA-PSK2**, and **WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK Mixed Mode**.\n\n> **Image:** Access Point Encryption\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n**WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK Mixed Mode** is the recommended type of encryption.\n\n\nWhen the desired protection is chosen, a **Key** field will pop up. In the **Key** field, enter a password to protect the AP. The green arrows ![13.a](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/subdocument1/13.a.png) on the right will show/hide the password.\n\n> **Image:** Access Point Password\n\nOptionally, you can hide the AP by enabling the **Hidden** option. To connect to a hidden AP, you must manually type the ESSID, choose the correct encryption type, and type the password. \n","keywords":[],"source_file":"software-apis-and-libraries\\wisgateos\\wi-fi-modes-configuration.md","token_count":0}

After the correct one is selected, a **Key** field will pop up.\n\n> **Image:** Client Encryption and Password\n\nIn the **Key** field, you must type the password that protects the wireless network. The green arrows ![13.a](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/subdocument1/13.a.png) right to the field will show/hide the password.\n\nBelow the **Wireless Client** menu, you can see the **Status** of the mode and select what protocol to use. You can choose between **Static address** or **DHCP client**. \n\nIn the **DHCP mode**, there is not much to configure. The DHCP server of the router will set an IP for the gateway. You can enable/disable the **Use DNS servers advertised by peer** button. If the button is unchecked, the advertised DNS server addresses are going to be ignored. Optionally, you can override the MTU.\n\n> **Image:** DHCP Client Protocol\n\nIf you chooses the Static address protocol, it can set a static IP address for the gateway. This way, after a reboot or restart of the router, the gateway will keep the assigned IP address.\n\nTo do so, you must type the IP of the network in the **IPv4 address** field (or the **IPv6 address** one if that version is used). In the **IPv4 netmask** field (or in **IPv6 routed prefix**), you must type the subnet mask (prefix for IPv6) of the IP address. For example the netmask for 192.168.0.128 is 255.255.255.0. \n\nIn the **IPv4 gateway** (or **IPv6 gateway**) field, you must type the IP that will be assigned to the gateway.\n\nAdditionally, you can use custom DNS servers via the **Use custom DNS servers** field. You can add more than one server with the list button ![13.c](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/subdocument1/13.c.png).\n\nIn the **Override MTU** field,  you can set a size for the largest packet or frame that can be sent over the network. The MTU of an Ethernet connection is 1500 bytes.\n\n> **Image:** Static Address Protocol\n","keywords":[],"source_file":"software-apis-and-libraries\\wisgateos\\wi-fi-modes-configuration.md","token_count":0}
