If you want to run ChirpStack on a different host/cloud, then refer to the [guide](https://www.chirpstack.io/guides/debian-ubuntu/) on the ChirpStack site.  \n> **WARNING:** Remember to run the `sudo gateway-config` command in the CLI and point the gateway to the IP address of the machine you just installed ChirpStack on. This can be done in item 2 in the menu **Setup RAK Gateway LoRa concentrator**.  \nAssuming you have set it up correctly, log in to your ChirpStack to register your gateway by opening the ChirpStack's web page in a browser by entering:  \n- **Browser Address**: `<IP Address of ChirpStack>:8080`\n- **Username**: admin\n- **Password**: admin  \n> **Image:** ChirpStack login page  \nClick **Gateways** and select **+ CREATE** to register your gateway.  \n> **Image:** ChirpStack registered gateways  \n> **Image:** Registering your gateway  \nAfter registering your gateway, fill in the necessary information.  \n> **Image:** Filling in the details  \nFill in the gateway ID you got from the [Configuring the Gateway](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7248/quickstart/#configuring-the-gateway) section, also called gateway EUI.  \nIf you have properly configured your gateway and there is a network connection between the external ChirpStack and your gateway, you should see the same page and status.  \n> **Image:** Successfully registered gateway  \nCongratulations! You have now successfully connected your gateway to an external ChirpStack!"}
