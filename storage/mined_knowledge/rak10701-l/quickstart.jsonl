The device will be added to the blockchain and it will show pending beside its name.  \n> **Image:** Pending Device Status  \n5. While waiting for the device to be added to the blockchain, you can create a `Label`. This will allow you to group your device to have a common setting. This will be needed to attach the needed integrations to the backend server of `dev.disk91.com`. You have to click the folder with the + icon and add a `Label` name then click `Save Label`. The newly created label should now be shown in the `Devices` console.  \n> **Image:** Add Label icon  \n> **Image:** Add Label Name  \n> **Image:** Label created successfully  \n6.

The device is properly labeled which is needed for the next steps - `Integrations` and `Flow`.  \n> **Image:** Label added on the RAK10701 device  \n9. To connect the backend server, you have to create an `Integration`.  \n> **Image:** Add integration  \n> **Image:** HTTP integration  \n10. Then you must proceed to steps 2 and 3 sections of the `Integration` settings. You have to select `POST` then on the Endpoint URL, you must put `https://dev.disk91.com/fieldtester/helium/v3`. It is also needed to put the integration name before the clicking **Add Integration** button.  \n> **Image:** Details of HTTP Integration  \n11. After preparing the device and the integration, you can now proceed with creating the flow to connect them.

Once you are logged in, you can start adding your device. You have two ways to add a device as shown in the image.  \n> **Image:** Adding Device  \n3. The newly added device parameters will be shown. You have to put a device name and click save.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThe DEVEUI, APPEUI, and APPKEY are important in this step.

The device will be added to the blockchain and it will show pending beside its name.  \n> **Image:** Pending Device Status  \n5. While waiting for the device to be added to the blockchain, you can create a `Label`. This will allow you to group your device to have a common setting. This will be needed to attach the needed integrations to the backend server of `dev.disk91.com`. You have to click the folder with the + icon and add a `Label` name then click `Save Label`. The newly created label should now be shown in the `Devices` console.  \n> **Image:** Add Label icon  \n> **Image:** Add Label Name  \n> **Image:** Label created successfully  \n6.

To connect the backend server, you have to create an `Integration`.  \n> **Image:** Add integration  \n> **Image:** HTTP integration  \n10. Then you must proceed to steps 2 and 3 sections of the `Integration` settings. You have to select `POST` then on the Endpoint URL, you must put `https://dev.disk91.com/fieldtester/helium/v3`. It is also needed to put the integration name before the clicking **Add Integration** button.  \n> **Image:** Details of HTTP Integration  \n11. After preparing the device and the integration, you can now proceed with creating the flow to connect them. You have to click `Flows` and then the `+` icon on `NODES`.  \n> **Image:** Setting up the Flows  \n12. You must select `Labels` and `Integrations` and then drag the correct blocks on the flows canvas.  \n> **Image:** Drag the rak10701-devices label  \n> **Image:** Drag the RAK1070x_Integration  \n13.

You must also input a name on the `Packet Config Name`, select `Multiple Packets` and drag the slider, so it will show `All Available Packets`. Once done, you can now click on `+ Create Packet Config`.  \n> **Image:** Multiple packets configuration  \n> **Image:** Successful packets creation  \n16. You must associate the multiple packet setup with the `rak10701-devices` label. To do this, you have to go back on `Flows`, double-click on the `rak10701-devices` label, choose the `Packets` tab under rak10701-devices settings then enable `ALL Packets`. After this, you can now proceed with the configuration of RAK10701 using WisToolBox.  \n> **Image:** Attaching multiple packets to the rak10701-devices label  \n17. You can now proceed on [device configuration](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak10701-l/quickstart/#configuration-of-rak10701-l-using-wistoolbox) so that the proper EUIs and KEY will match the one in the Helium network."}
