First, remove the screws.  \n> **Image:** Removing screws from the WisBlock module  \n2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.  \n> **Image:** Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module  \n3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 6**, to detach the module from the baseboard.  \n> **Image:** Applying even forces on the proper location of a WisBlock module  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\nIf you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743306645143-How-To-Use-the-WisBlock-IO-Pin-Mapping-Tool) tool for possible conflicts.  \nAfter all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.  \n> **WARNING:** - Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.\n- Only 3.7-4.2V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.\n- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.\n- Only 5V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.\n- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring."}
