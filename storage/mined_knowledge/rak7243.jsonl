To learn more, refer to the ChirpStack [site](https://www.chirpstack.io/).\n\nWhen it comes to RAK7243 WisGate Developer D3 Gateway, there are two (2) ways to use the ChirpStack:\n\n### Using the Built-In ChirpStack\n\nThere is a built-in ChirpStack in every RAK Developer gateway if you use the latest firmware or the `rak_common_for_gateway` repository.\n\n- When you use it for the first time after burning the latest firmware, the gateway will work in the **EU868 Band**, and it will use the built-in ChirpStack as its default LoRa Server. If you don't want to change the frequency or LoRa Server, you don't have to do anything as this will be configured automatically when the gateway boots.\n\n- However, if it is not the first time you use the gateway and you want to use the built-in ChirpStack as the LoRa Server, follow the steps discussed in the [Configuring the Gateway](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7243/quickstart/#configuring-the-gateway) section.\n\n- **Optional** - If ever you have disabled the **AP Mode** and connected it to your own Wi-Fi network **(Client Mode)**, you can search for your gateway’s IP Address via [Advanced IP Scanner](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/).\n\n- There is a **Web-based UI** that comes with the ChirpStack instance. Open a browser and enter the following credentials:\n\n    - **Browser Address**: `<Gateway IP address>:8080` (Example: `http://192.168.0.100:8080` )\n    - **Username**: admin\n    - **Password**: admin\n\n\n> **WARNING:** It is advisable to **change your password** to tighten the security of your account. You can change this by clicking the change password button at the user icon.\n\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack web-based UI\n\n- Everything should be pre-configured - **Device profiles** have been created, the gateway has been registered with the server, etc. If you go to the **Gateways tab** and click on **rak_gateway**, you should see the gateway details page.\n\n> **Image:** Available gateway in Chirpstack\n\n- Go to **Gateways** and see the **Last seen status**. It must be a few seconds ago, which signifies that the gateway is visible in the ChirpStack server.\n\n> **Image:** Last seen status\n\n### Using an Independent ChirpStack\n\nYou can setup an independent ChirpStack by yourself and can set a ChirpStack in AWS. Refer to the [AWS guide](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN). If you want to run ChirpStack on a different host/cloud, then refer to the [guide](https://www.chirpstack.io/guides/debian-ubuntu/) on the ChirpStack site.\n\n\n> **WARNING:** Remember to run the `sudo gateway-config` command in the CLI and point the gateway to the IP address of the machine you just installed ChirpStack on.
