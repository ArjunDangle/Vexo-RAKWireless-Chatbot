Start by accessing the gateway.  \n> **Image:** Login page  \n2. Login using the set credentials you have set in the [Access the Gateway](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7267/quickstart#access-the-gateway) section.\n3. On the left side, head to **LoRa**. By default, the gateway is configured to work as **Built-in network server**.\n4. From **Work Mode**, select **Packet forwarder**. Click **Choose from the available protocols** to expand the Packet forwarder settings.  \n> **Image:** Setting packet forwarder mode  \n5. To use the built-in gateway bridge, from the **Protocol** select **LoRa Gateway MQTT Bridge**.  \n> **Image:** LoRa Gateway MQTT bridge  \n6. Choose **MQTT for ChirpStack 4.x (PROTOBUF)** as the MQTT protocol.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE  \n+ The ChirpStack v3 supports both **MQTT for ChirpStack 3.x (JSON)** and **MQTT for ChirpStack 3.x (PROTOBUF)**. If you are using an earlier version of ChirpStack (v3), you need to choose one of the MQTT protocols to use.\n+ If you want to use the JSON protocol, you need to change the payload marshaler in the gateway bridge `.toml` file to `.json`. By default, the marshaler is protobuf. To configure the payload marshaler, you will use the SSH client PuTTY to access the configuration files. How to do this is explained in the [Learn Site](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN/#accessing-instance-via-ssh).  \nBy default, the built-in gateway bridge is pointed to the local broker (127.0.0.1). To point the gateway to the ChirpStack network, you need to set the ChirpStack Broker address in the **MQTT Broker Address** field.  \nIn this case, the ChirpStack is installed on an AWS cloud instance with public IP `18.156.176.220` (yours will be different). The default port that the MQTT Broker uses is 1883.  \n> **Image:** Configuring packet forwarder to ChirpStack  \n7. Click **Save changes** to save the changes.  \nIf everything is set correctly, the gateway will display as online. You can click the gateway name to inspect the gateway traffic.  \n> **Image:** Registered gateway  \n> **Image:** Gateway details"}
