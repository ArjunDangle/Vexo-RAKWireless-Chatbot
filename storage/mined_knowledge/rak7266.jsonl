If you are using an earlier version of ChirpStack (v3), you need to choose one of the MQTT protocols to use.\n+ If you want to use the JSON protocol, you need to change the payload marshaler in the gateway bridge `.toml` file to `.json`. By default, the marshaler is protobuf. To configure the payload marshaler, use the SSH client PuTTY to access the configuration files. How to do this is explained in the [Amazon Web Services with LoRaWAN](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN/?utm_source=docs_center&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=rak7266-documentation-lns-guide-page&utm_term=amazon-web-services-with-lorawan&utm_content=learn-link#accessing-instance-via-ssh) guide on Learn site.\n\n\n6. To point the gateway to the ChirpStack network, you need to set the ChirpStack Broker address in the **MQTT Broker Address** field. In this case, the ChirpStack is installed on an AWS cloud instance with public IP `18.156.176.220` (yours will be different). The default port that the MQTT Broker uses is 1883.\n\n> **Image:** Configure packet forwarder to ChirpStack\n\n7.

Make sure the gateway is switched off before inserting or ejecting the SIM card.\n\n\n### Insert SIM Card\n\n1. On the **back** of the gateway, locate the **NanoSIM card slot**.\n\n> **Image:**  Inserting SIM card\n\n2. Insert the **NanoSIM card** into the slot, ensuring it is properly inserted.\n\n### Mount the Bracket\n\nThe gateway can be mounted in multiple ways: wall-mounting, ceiling-mounting, or using a rail. Choose the appropriate mounting style based on your environment and needs.\n\n#### Wall Mounting\n\n1. Use a **5-mm drill bit** to drill three holes on the wall where you want to mount the gateway. It’s recommended to mark the hole positions before drilling to ensure accurate placement.\n2. Insert the expansion plugs into the drilled holes.\n3. Secure the mounting bracket to the wall using screws through the bracket holes.\n\n> **Image:**  Mounting bracket\n\n#### Ceiling Mounting\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nFor ceiling mounting, ensure the ceiling is strong enough to support the gateway. Mark the hole positions before drilling.\n\n\n1. Choose either self-tapping screws or expansion tubes with self-tapping screws to install the bracket, depending on the material of the ceiling.\n2. (Optional) Refer to this step when installing the bracket using expansion tubes and self-tapping screws. Otherwise, skip it.\n  - Use a 5 mm drill bit to drill 3 holes in the ceiling.\n  - Insert the expansion tubes into the holes drilled in the ceiling.\n3. Secure the bracket to the ceiling using self-tapping screws through the holes in the bracket.\n\n> **Image:**  Mounting bracket\n\n#### T-Shaped Keel Mounting\n\nYou can use a T-shaped keel for mounting the bracket on a rail system. The following instructions apply to a T-shaped keel, but other types of rails can also be used.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThe bracket supports rail widths of 14 mm, 16 mm, and 24 mm.\n\n\n1. Remove the mounting clip from the bracket.\n2. Insert one side of the T-shaped keel into the two clips of the bracket.\n3. Insert the two T-shaped hooks on the mounting clip into the T-shaped rails of the bracket, slide the mounting clip to the other side of the T-shaped keel, and make sure the clip is in place.\n\n> **Image:**  Mounting bracket\n\n### Install the Gateway\n\n1. Align the lower edge of the gateway's hanging hole with the bracket's locking plate.\n2. Move the gateway closer to the bracket until the bracket's locking plate engages with the gateway's hanging hole.\n3.
