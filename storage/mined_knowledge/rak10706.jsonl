The sending starts at the lowest possible data rate and increases each packet until the highest possible data rate is reached.\n\n### Outdoor Testing\n\nIn this scenario, location tracking should be enabled to include the tester's location in the test results. The log files will contain the location of the tester at the time the test was performed. If no location is found, the location will be set to Lat 0, Long 0.\n\n### Indoor Testing\n\nIn this scenario the location tracking should be disabled, as the GNSS chip cannot acquire a valid location inside buildings. The log files will not contain the location of the tester.\n\n### LinkCheck Testing\n\nIf it is not possible to connect the backend server to the LoRaWAN server to process the received packet data, the LinkCheck method is used. It provides basic information about connection quality and indicates whether the tester is within the coverage range of gateways.\n\n### LoRa P2P Testing\nThis is a very basic test that only shows whether the device is in range from another LoRa P2P device that is sending out packets. In this mode, the device is listening and displaying information if it has received a data packet. It will as well send out data packets in the send interval that is setup on the device.\n","keywords":[],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak10706\\quickstart.md","token_count":0}

The device will send a payload with this interval. The time is set in seconds, e.g. `AT+SENDINT=600` sets the send interval to 600 seconds or 10 minutes.\n- `ATC+MODE` to set the test mode. 0 using LPWAN LinkCheck, 1 using LoRa P2P, 2 using FieldTester protocol, 3 using FieldTester PLUS protocol.\n- `ATC+STATUS` to get status information from the device.\n- `ATC+PCKG` to setup a custom payload that is used in the uplink packets (only Linkcheck test mode and LoRa P2P test mode).\n- `ATC+LOGS` to retrieve or erase saved log files from the SD card (if SD card is present). See [AT commands for log files](#at-commands-for-log-files).\n- `ATC+RTC` to set or get time of RTC (if RTC module is present). Set format = [yyyy:mm:dd:hh:MM] (discard leading zeros)\n\n### Setup with AT Commands\n\n#### LoRa P2P Setup\n\nTo use the device in LoRa P2P mode, it has to be set into this mode with:\n```\nAT+NWM=0\n```\nThe device might reboot after this command, if it was not already in P2P mode.\n\nNext, the LoRa P2P parameters need to be set up. In this example, the device is being set to the following:\n\n| Frequency | 916100000 Hz |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bandwidth | 125 kHz |\n| Spreading Factor | 7 |\n| Coding Rate | 45387 |\n| Preamble Length | 8 |\n| TX power | 5 dBm |\n\n```\nAT+PRECV=0\nAT+P2P=916000000:7:0:1:8:5\nATC+MODE=2\n```\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nIf the credentials were set already (they are saved in the flash of the device), the switch to P2P testing can as well be done with:\n`ATC+MODE=2`\n\nThe device might reboot after this command, if it was not already in LoRa P2P mode.\n\nThe command AT+PRECV=0 is required to stop the device from listening. While in RX mode, parameters cannot be changed.\n\n\nTo be able to receive packets from other devices, they have to be setup to exactly the same parameters.\n\n#### LoRaWAN LinkCheck Setup\n\nTo use the device in LoRaWAN mode, it has to be set into this mode with:\n```\nAT+NWM=1\n```\nThe device might reboot after this command, if it was not already in LoRaWAN mode.\nThen the LoRaWAN parameters and credentials have to be setup. In this example, I am setting the device to AS923-3, OTAA join mode, unconfirmed packet mode, enable link check and then reset the device to perform a LoRaWAN JOIN sequence:\n```\nAT+BAND=10\nAT+NJM=1\nAT+CFM=0\nAT+LINKCHECK=2\nAT+DEVEUI=AC1F09FFFE000000\nAT+APPEUI=AC1F09FFFE000000\nAT+APPKEY=AC1F09FFFE000000AC1F09FFFE000000\nATC+MODE=0\nATZ\n```\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n- If the credentials have already been set (they are saved in the device's flash), the switch to LinkCheck testing can also be performed with:\n`ATC+MODE=0`\n  - The device might reboot after this command, if it was not already in LoRaWAN mode.\n\n- The device must be registered with a LoRaWAN server using these credentials, and a gateway within range must be connected to the server. Otherwise, the device cannot join the network, and no tests can be performed. If the device fails to join, an error will be displayed on the screen: **LoRaWAN Join Failed**\n  - In this case, double check all settings on the device and LoRaWAN server, and check if a gateway is in range and connected to the LoRaWAN server.\n\n\n#### LoRaWAN FieldTester & FieldTester Pro Setup\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThese test modes do not offer the complete functionality of the RAK10701-L and RAK10701-PLUS Field Testers.\n\n\nTo use the device in LoRaWAN mode, it has to be set into this mode with\n```\nAT+NWM=1\n```\nThe device might reboot after this command, if it was not already in LoRaWAN mode.\nThen the LoRaWAN parameters and credentials have to be setup. In this example, I am setting the device to AS923-3, OTAA join mode, confirmed packet mode, disable link check and then reset the device to perform a LoRaWAN JOIN sequence:\n```\nAT+BAND=10\nAT+NJM=1\nAT+CFM=1\nAT+LINKCHECK=0\nAT+DEVEUI=AC1F09FFFE000000\nAT+APPEUI=AC1F09FFFE000000\nAT+APPKEY=AC1F09FFFE000000AC1F09FFFE000000\nATC+MODE=3\nATZ\n```\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n- If the credentials have already been set (they are saved in the device's flash), the switch to FieldTester testing can also be performed with:\n`ATC+MODE=3`\n  - The device might reboot after this command, if it was not already in LoRaWAN mode.\n\n- In FieldTester Mode a backend server has to be set up as integration in the LoRaWAN server. Without this backend server, the FieldTester Mode will not work.\n  - More information about available backend solutions can be found in the [RAK10701-L documentation](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak10701-l/quickstart/).\n\n- The device has to be registered in a LoRaWAN server with these credentials and a gateway in range has to be connected to the LoRaWAN server. Otherwise, the device cannot join and there are no tests possible. If the device cannot join the network, it will show an error on the display: **LoRaWAN Join Failed**\n  - In this case, double check all settings on the device and LoRaWAN server, and check if a gateway is in range and connected to the LoRaWAN server.\n\n\n### Usage\nThe principle usage for all modes is similar. After selecting the mode and setting the correct parameters and credentials, the device will send uplink packets in the selected send interval.\n\n\n> **WARNING:** Important\nWhen using FieldTester mode, the device requires a valid location fix from its built-in GNSS module. Otherwise, it will not send any uplink packets.\n\n\n#### LoRa P2P\n\nIf the setup of all devices is the same and a packet is received, the display will show the received LoRa P2P packets:\n\n- P2P received packet number\n- Frequency, spreading factor and bandwidth\n- RSSI\n- SNR\n\n> **Image:** LoRa P2P RX\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nAn uplink can be manually triggered by pushing the button three times.\n\n\nAfter a packet is sent, the display shown in **Figure 49** will appear.:\n\n> **Image:** LoRa P2P RX\n\n#### LoRaWAN LinkCheck\n\nAfter the device has joined the network, it will send confirmed packets with LinkCheck request enabled to the LoRaWAN server. The LoRaWAN server will answer to the LinkCheck request. The display will show the following:\n- Linkcheck result\n- Demodulation Margin from the LoRaWAN server\n- DR of the sent packet\n- Number of gateways\n- Number of sent and lost packets\n- RSSI and SNR of the received packet\n\n> **Image:** LoRaWAN LinkCheckAns\n\nIf the device is out of range of the gateways (after having previously joined), it will show an error message if the LoRaWAN server did respond to the LinkCheck request:\n- Linkcheck result\n- Number of sent and lost packets\n- Error value\n- DR of the sent packet\n\n> **Image:** LoRaWAN no LinkCheckAns\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n- An uplink can be manually triggered by pushing the button three times.\n- To check all possible data rates, multiple uplinks can be triggered by pressing the button four times. The packets will be sent starting with the lowest possible DR, and with each packet, the DR will increase until the highest possible rate is reached.\n\n\n#### LoRaWAN FieldTester\n\nAfter the device has joined the network, it will send confirmed packets with location information to the LoRaWAN server. The LoRaWAN server will forward this information together with gateway information to the backend server. The backend server will create and send a downlink packet to the tester. The display will show the following:\n- RSSI and SNR level of the received downlink packet\n- Number of gateways that received the packet\n- Min and Max RSSI levels seen by the gateways\n- Min and Max calculated distance between the tester and the gateways\n- Number of sent packets and number of lost packets\n\n> **Image:** Fieldtester display\n\nBefore sending an uplink packet, the tester will try to acquire a location.\n\n> **Image:** Fieldtester location acquisition\n\nIf a location fix can be acquired, an uplink packet will be sent, followed by waiting for the downlink packet from the backend server. The display's headline will show an _**O**_ to indicate that a location was acquired.\n\n> **Image:** Fieldtester location fix\n\nIf no location fix can be acquired, an error will be displayed and no packet will be sent. The display's headline will show an _**X**_ to indicate that no location was acquired.\n\n> **Image:** Fieldtester location failure\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n- An uplink can be manually triggered by pushing the button three times.\n- To check all possible data rates, multiple uplinks can be triggered by pressing the button four times. The packets will be sent starting with the lowest possible DR, and with each packet, the DR will increase until the highest possible rate is reached.\n\n\n\n> **WARNING:** Important\n- In FieldTester Mode a backend server must be set up as integration in the LoRaWAN server. Without this backend server, the FieldTester Mode will not work.\n- More information about available backend solutions can be found in the [RAK10701 documentation](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak10701-p/quickstart/#lorawan-network-servers-guide-for-rak10701-p-field-tester-pro/)\n\n\n### Log Files (If SD Card is Present)\n\nIf an SD card is present, the results of the coverage tests are written in CSV format to the SD card. The files start from `0000-log.csv`, and on each restart, a new file with an incrementing number is created.\n\n#### AT commands for Log Files\n\n_**`ATC+LOGS=?`**_ is used to retrieve the log files over the USB port. This makes it possible to read the log files without removing the SD card from the device.\n\n_**`ATC+LOGS=e`**_ is used to erase all log files from the SD card.\n\n----\n\n#### Linkcheck Mode Log Format\n\nWhen in Linkcheck mode for LoRaWAN, the log file has the following format:\n\n##### If Location is Enabled\n\n`time;Mode;Gw;Lat;Lng;RX RSSI;RX SNR;Demod;TX DR;Lost`\n\n##### If Location is Disabled\n\n`time;Mode;Gw;RX RSSI;RX SNR;Demod;TX DR;Lost`\n\n| PARAMETER | DECSRIPTION | VALUES |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `time` | Time stamp (available if LNS has provided the time or if a RTC module is attached) | 2024-10-07 14:35:204 |\n| `Mode` | 0 for LinkCheck mode | 0 |\n| `Gw` | Number of gateways | 1 |\n| `Lat` | Latitude (if location is active and location fix) | 14.521355 |\n| `Lng` | Longitude (if location is active and location fix) | 121.10688 |\n| `RX RSSI` | RSSI of downlink | -91 |\n| `RX SNR` | SNR of downlink | 8 |\n| `Demod` | Demodulation value | 29 |\n| `TX DR` | TX datarate | 3 |\n| `Lost` | Number of lost packets | 0 |\n\n----\n\n#### FieldTester Mode Log Format\n\nWhen in FieldTester mode for LoRaWAN, the log file has the following format:\n\n`time;Mode;Gw;Lat;Lng;min RSSI;max RSSI;RX RSSI;RX SNR;min Dist;max Dist;TX DR`\n\n| PARAMETER | DECSRIPTION | VALUES |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `time` | Time stamp (available if LNS has provided the time or if a RTC module is attached) | 2024-10-07 14:39:00 |\n| `Mode` | 2 for FieldTester mode | 2 |\n| `Gw` | Number of gateways | 1 |\n| `Lat` | Latitude (can be 0.0 if no location fix, e.g. indoor testing) | 14.521355 |\n| `Lng` | Longitude (can be 0.0 if no location fix, e.g. indoor testing) | 121.10688 |\n| `min RSSI` | Minimum RSSI seen by gateways | -50 |\n| `max RSSI` | Maximum RSSI seen by gateways | -50 |\n| `RX RSSI` | RSSI of downlink | -59 |\n| `RX SNR` | SNR of downlink | 7 |\n| `min Dist` | Minimum distance to gateway(s) | 250 |\n| `max Dist` | Maximum distance to gateway(s) | 250 |\n| `TX DR` | TX datarate | 5 |\n\n----\n\n#### P2P Mode Log Format\n\nWhen in Linkcheck mode for LoRaWAN, the log file has the following format:\n\n##### If Location is Enabled\n\n`time;Mode;Lat;Lng;RX RSSI;RX SNR`\n\n##### If Location is Disabled\n\n`time;Mode;RX RSSI;RX SNR`\n\n| PARAMETER | DECSRIPTION | VALUES |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `time` | Time stamp (available if LNS has provided the time or if a RTC module is attached) | 2024-10-07 14:51:21 |\n| `Mode` | 1 for LinkCheck mode | 1 |\n| `Lat` | Latitude (if location is active and location fix) | 14.521355 |\n| `Lng` | Longitude (if location is active and location fix) | 121.10688 |\n| `RX RSSI` | RSSI of downlink | -38 |\n| `RX SNR` | SNR of downlink | 12 |\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n#### Upgrading the Firmware\n\nIt is recommended to update to the latest version of the firmware.
