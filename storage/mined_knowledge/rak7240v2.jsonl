If you're using a cellular model, connect the LTE antennas as well.\n2. **(Optional)** If you plan to use PoE for power or Ethernet for network connectivity, you may now connect an Ethernet cable to the gateway's ETH (PoE) port.\n\n#### Lightning Protection (Recommended)\n\n\n> **WARNING:** Lightning strikes can generate powerful electrical surges that may harm sensitive electronic devices. It is essential to take appropriate precautions to minimize the risk of damage. The warranty provided does not cover damages resulting from lightning strikes or other acts of nature.\n\n\nTo ensure optimal performance and protect your equipment from potential damage, it is strongly recommended to install proper **grounding** and **lightning protection** for:\n+ All **antenna connectors** (LoRa®, GPS, Wi-Fi, LTE)\n+ The **ETH(PoE)** port\n+ The gateway enclosure\n\n> **Image:** Full lightning protection set-up\n\n##### Outdoor Surge Protection System\n\n- **Antenna Grounding**\n\n  Install a lightning arrestor on each antenna's N-type terminal (LoRa®, LTE, Wi-Fi, GPS). The arrestors must be N-type Female to Male to match the antenna and enclosure connectors.\n  Use **10 AWG or thicker** grounding wire to connect the arrestor's screw terminal to the **grounding rail mounted on the building wall** or a **grounding bar** in field deployments.\n- **Gateway Grounding**\n\n  Connect the grounding screw located on the bottom side of the gateway to the same grounding rail or bar using a **10 AWG or thicker** wire. This ensures proper discharge path for any electrical surges through the gateway chassis.\n\n##### Indoor Surge Protection\n\nTo protect **indoor devices** connected to the gateway (e.g., PoE injectors, switches, routers), install an **Ethernet SPD (Surge Protection Device)** along the cable between the gateway and the PoE injector.\n\n##### Recommended Equipment\n\n- [Lightning Arrestor for GPS Antenna](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/lightning-arrestor-for-gps-antenna): A surge protection device designed specifically for GPS antennas. It uses a high-pass filter to block low-frequency lightning-induced interference while maintaining minimal insertion loss for GPS signals. The device integrates a **TVS diode** and **gas discharge tube (GDT)** to protect the DC feed circuit from transients and over-voltage events.\n- [Lightning arrestor for the LoRa, LTE and Wi-Fi antennas](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/lightning-arrestor): This is a surge protection device for securing transceivers against over-voltage and surge current induced by lightning bolts. RAKwireless recommends installing lightning arrestors on all N-type antenna terminals, including LTE and 2.4G Wi-Fi antennas.\n- [Signal Surge Protective Device](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/signal-surge-protective?variant=29842390122541?utm_source=signalsurgeprotectivedevice&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore): Designed for **CAT6 or Class E network cables**, this SPD protects Ethernet-connected equipment from voltage surges induced by lightning or internal switching transients. It is widely used in industrial and office communication systems, including **Gigabit Ethernet**, **ATM**, **ISDN**, and **VoIP**.\n\n#### Weather Protection\n\nTo better protect the Ethernet cable gland and the antenna connector from the weather, cover them with PVC tape.\n1. Clean the surface area of the connector that will be wrapped. Wrap a layer of PVC tape with a 50% overlap according to the rotation direction of the connector. Continue wrapping the PVC tape to about 10 mm below the end of the connector.\n\n> **Image:** Wrapping with PVC tape\n\n2. Cut off about 50 cm waterproof tape. Stretch it to double its length and wrap three layers around the connector with a 50% overlap. Hold the tape in place with your hand for a few seconds.\n\n> **Image:** Wrapping with waterproof tape\n\n3. Wrap three additional layers with PVC tape with natural uncoiling force and a 50% overlap. Ensure to cover the head and the tail of the connector.\n\n> **Image:** Final PVC wrapping\n","keywords":[],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7240v2\\quickstart.md","token_count":0}

On the first login, you must set a login password. The password must:\n    - At least 12 characters long\n    - Has at least one special character (`!“#$%&\\‘()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_{|}~`)\n    - Has at least one number\n    - Has at least one standard Latin letter (used in the English alphabet)\n\n> **Image:** Web UI login page\n\n4.
