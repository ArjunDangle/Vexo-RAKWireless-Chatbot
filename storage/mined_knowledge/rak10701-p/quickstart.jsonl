The device will be added to the blockchain and it will show pending beside its name.  \n> **Image:** Pending Device Status  \n5. While waiting for the device to be added to the blockchain, you can create a `Label`. This will allow you to group your device to have a common setting. This will be needed to attach the needed integrations to the backend server of `dev.disk91.com`. You have to click the folder with the + icon and add a `Label` name then click `Save Label`. The newly created label should now be shown in the `Devices` console.  \n> **Image:** Add Label icon  \n> **Image:** Add Label Name  \n> **Image:** Label created successfully  \n6.

It is also needed to put the integration name before the clicking Add integration button.  \n> **Image:** Details of HTTP Integration  \n11.

While waiting for the device to be added to the blockchain, you can create a `Label`. This will allow you to group your device to have a common setting. This will be needed to attach the needed integrations to the backend server of `dev.disk91.com`. You have to click the folder with the + icon and add a `Label` name then click `Save Label`.

The device is properly labeled which is needed for the next steps - `Integrations` and `Flow`.  \n> **Image:** Label added on the RAK10701 device  \n9. To connect the backend server, you have to create an `Integration`.  \n> **Image:** Add integration  \n> **Image:** HTTP integration  \n10. Then you must proceed to steps 2 and 3 sections of the `Integration` settings. You have to select `POST` then on the Endpoint URL, you must put `https://dev.disk91.com/fieldtester/helium/v3`. It is also needed to put the integration name before the clicking Add integration button.  \n> **Image:** Details of HTTP Integration  \n11. After preparing the device and the integration, you can now proceed with creating the flow to connect them.

You must select `Labels` and `Integrations` and then drag the correct blocks on the flows canvas.  \n> **Image:** Drag the rak10701-devices label  \n> **Image:** Drag the RAK1070x_Integration  \n13. You then have to connect the `Label` block to the `Integration` block via the tiny connector indicated by the red arrows by using your mouse cursor and dragging the line connector.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThere is no need to save the changes created on the flows canvas since it is automatically saved as you do changes.  \n> **Image:** Connecting Labels to Integrations  \n14. The final step in the setting up of the Helium Console for RAK10701 is the setting up of packets. You have to click on `Packets` and then the `Add New Packet Config` icon.  \n> **Image:** Creating Packets  \n15. You must also input a name on the `Packet Config Name`, select `Multiple Packets` and drag the slider so it will show `All Available Packets`. Once done, you can now click on `+ Create Packet Config`.  \n> **Image:** Multiple packets configuration  \n> **Image:** Successful packets creation  \n16. You must associate the multiple packet setup with the `rak10701-devices` label. To do this, you have to go back on `Flows`, double-click on the `rak10701-devices` label, choose the `Packets` tab under rak10701-devices settings then enable `ALL Packets`. After this, you can now proceed with the configuration of RAK10701 using WisToolBox.  \n> **Image:** Attaching multiple packets to the rak10701-devices label  \n17. You can now proceed on [device configuration](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak10701-p/quickstart/#configuration-of-rak10701-p-using-wistoolbox) so that the proper EUIs and KEY will match the one in the Helium network."}

This is a public LoRaWAN network server that you can use for your LoRaWAN end-devices powered by community-driven Helium Hotspots. This guide will show every detail of how to prepare the Helium Console for your RAK10701-P Field Tester Pro.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThis guide is based on [disk19 guide for the Field Tester](https://github.com/disk91/WioLoRaWANFieldTester/blob/master/doc/ConfigureHelium.md) configuration for the Helium Console.  \n1. You need to register an account and then purchase data credits (DC) to use the network. If you are a new user, there are free data credits (DC) included in your new account to get you started quickly.  \n> **Image:** Helium Console  \n> **Image:** Console Home Page  \n2. Once you are logged in, you can start adding your device. You have two ways to add a device as shown in the image.  \n> **Image:** Adding Device  \n3. The newly added device parameters will be shown. You have to put a device name and click save.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThe DEVEUI, APPEUI, and APPKEY are important in this step. These values must be configured on your RAK10701-P device using WisToolBox which will be covered later in this guide.  \n> **Image:** Configuring Device Name  \n4. The device will be added to the blockchain and it will show pending beside its name.  \n> **Image:** Pending Device Status  \n5. While waiting for the device to be added to the blockchain, you can create a `Label`. This will allow you to group your device to have a common setting. This will be needed to attach the needed integrations to the backend server of `dev.disk91.com`. You have to click the folder with the + icon and add a `Label` name then click `Save Label`. The newly created label should now be shown in the `Devices` console.  \n> **Image:** Add Label icon  \n> **Image:** Add Label Name  \n> **Image:** Label created successfully  \n6. Once the `Label` is created you have to associate it on the RAK10701 device. You can attach the `Label` on the device by clicking the **Add Label** button.  \n> **Image:** Attach a label to the device  \n7. A pop-up will be shown and you have to select the correct `Label` created for RAK10701 then click **Add Label**.  \n> **Image:** Drop-down on label selection  \n8. After successful attachment of `Label` on the devices, it should show one (1) device is under that `Label`. The device is properly labeled which is needed for the next steps - `Integrations` and `Flow`.  \n> **Image:** Label added on the RAK10701 device  \n9. To connect the backend server, you have to create an `Integration`.  \n> **Image:** Add integration  \n> **Image:** HTTP integration  \n10. Then you must proceed to steps 2 and 3 sections of the `Integration` settings. You have to select `POST` then on the Endpoint URL, you must put `https://dev.disk91.com/fieldtester/helium/v3`. It is also needed to put the integration name before the clicking Add integration button.  \n> **Image:** Details of HTTP Integration  \n11. After preparing the device and the integration, you can now proceed with creating the flow to connect them. You have to click `Flows` and then the `+` icon on `NODES`.  \n> **Image:** Setting up the Flows  \n12. You must select `Labels` and `Integrations` and then drag the correct blocks on the flows canvas.  \n> **Image:** Drag the rak10701-devices label  \n> **Image:** Drag the RAK1070x_Integration  \n13. You then have to connect the `Label` block to the `Integration` block via the tiny connector indicated by the red arrows by using your mouse cursor and dragging the line connector.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThere is no need to save the changes created on the flows canvas since it is automatically saved as you do changes.  \n> **Image:** Connecting Labels to Integrations  \n14. The final step in the setting up of the Helium Console for RAK10701 is the setting up of packets. You have to click on `Packets` and then the `Add New Packet Config` icon.  \n> **Image:** Creating Packets  \n15. You must also input a name on the `Packet Config Name`, select `Multiple Packets` and drag the slider so it will show `All Available Packets`. Once done, you can now click on `+ Create Packet Config`.  \n> **Image:** Multiple packets configuration  \n> **Image:** Successful packets creation  \n16. You must associate the multiple packet setup with the `rak10701-devices` label. To do this, you have to go back on `Flows`, double-click on the `rak10701-devices` label, choose the `Packets` tab under rak10701-devices settings then enable `ALL Packets`. After this, you can now proceed with the configuration of RAK10701 using WisToolBox.  \n> **Image:** Attaching multiple packets to the rak10701-devices label  \n17. You can now proceed on [device configuration](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak10701-p/quickstart/#configuration-of-rak10701-p-using-wistoolbox) so that the proper EUIs and KEY will match the one in the Helium network."}
