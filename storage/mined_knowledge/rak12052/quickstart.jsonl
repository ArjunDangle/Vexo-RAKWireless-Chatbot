MLX90640 is a fully-calibrated 32x24 pixels thermal IR array in an industry-standard 4-lead TO39 package with a digital interface. The MLX90640 contains 768FIR pixels. An ambient sensor is integrated to measure the ambient temperature of the chip and a supply sensor to measure the VDD. The outputs of all sensors (IR, Ta, and VDD) are stored in internal RAM and accessible through I2C. It is comparable to having a thermal camera (or Predator's vision) but in compact but usable low resolution. For this example, you will be using the **RAK4631** as your WisBlock Core."}
