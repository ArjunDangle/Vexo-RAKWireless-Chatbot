Below are the pins available on the RAK811 Module that is on this Breakout board. For complete RAK811 module pinouts information, refer to the [datasheet](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/datasheet/#pin-definition).  \n1. **UART Pins**:  \n- Pin 7 (RX1) and Pin 6 (TX1) are reserved for UART1.\n- Pin 26 (RX3) and Pin 25 (TX3) are reserved for UART3.\n- During sleep, Pin 7 (RX1) and Pin 26 (RX3) are automatically configured as wake-up pins and in external interrupt mode with internal pull-down resistor.

Wake-up will be triggered by a rising edge on these RX pins.  \n2. **SWD debug Pins**: Pin 10 (SWDIO) and Pin 13 (SWCLK) are used for SWD connection.  \n3. **Power Pins**: The power pin on the RAK811 module includes the VCC pin on Pin 11, and Ground pins (GND) are on the Pin 1, Pin 12, Pin 21, Pin 28, Pin 29, Pin 30, Pin 31, Pin 32, and Pin 34.  \n4. **Reset Pin**: The reset pin on the RAK811 module is Pin 24 (RST).  \n5. **BOOT Pin**: The boot Pin on the RAK811 module is Pin 17 (BOOT0).  \n6. **RF Antenna Pin**: The RF antenna Pin on the RAK811 module is Pin 33 (RF_OUT).  \n7. **ADC Pins**: The ADC pins available on the RAK811 are different between the high and low-frequency modules.  \n- In the low-frequency modules, the ADC Pins are the following:\n- Pin 2 (PB12)\n- Pin 3 (PB14)\n- Pin 4 (PB15)\n- Pin 5 (PB13)\n- Pin 15 (PA3)\n- Pin 20 (PA2)\n- Pin 22 (PA1)\n- Pin 23 (PA0)  \n- In the high-frequency modules, the ADC Pins are the following:\n- Pin 2 (PB12)\n- Pin 3 (PB14)\n- Pin 4 (PB15)\n- Pin 20 (PA2)\n- Pin 22 (PA1)\n- Pin 23 (PA0)  \n8. **GPIO Pins**: The GPIO pins available on the RAK811 module are the following:\n- Pin 2\n- Pin 3\n- Pin 4\n- Pin 5\n- Pin 8\n- Pin 9\n- Pin 14\n- Pin 15\n- Pin 16\n- Pin 20\n- Pin 22\n- Pin 23  \n> **TIP:** NOTE  \nIf you plan to use the RAK811 Breakout Board in a product, it is essential to understand how to upgrade its firmware. The firmware can be updated via the **SWD** or **UART1** port, both of which require a general-purpose PC."}
