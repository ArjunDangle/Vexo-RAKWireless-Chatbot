Instructions on how to access your gateway via Web UI can be found in the product's [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7240v2/quickstart#access-the-gateway).  \n> **Image:** Register Gateway  \n5. After typing the EUI, click on **Confirm**. Additional fields will pop up. Fill in the following information:\n- **Gateway ID**: This will be the unique ID of your gateway in the Network. An ID based on the EUI is automatically generated. You can change it if you need. Note that the ID must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes (-).\n- **Gateway name**: Optionally, you can type a name for your gateway.\n- **Frequency plan**: The frequency plan used by the gateway.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\n- The other settings are optional and can be changed to satisfy your requirements.\n- For this tutorial, we will use Europe 863-870MHz (SF12 for RX2).  \n> **Image:** Adding a gateway  \n6. To register your gateway, click **Register gateway**.  \n> **Image:** Successfully added a gateway"}
