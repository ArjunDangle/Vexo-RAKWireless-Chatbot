Set a static IP address on your PC in the same subnet as the gateway:  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThe default IP is **169.254.X.X**. The last two segments(X.X) are mapped from the last four bits of the MAC address of your gateway. For example, the last four bits of the MAC address are `0F:01`, and the IP address is `169.254.15.1`. Make sure to manually set the address of your PC to one in the same network (for example, `169.254.15.100`).  \n3. Open the **Internet Properties** of your PC, and select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.  \n> **Image:** Internet properties  \n4. Select **Use the following IP address**, and set the PC's IP address (e.g., `169.254.15.100`). Ensure the PC's IP address is in the same subnet as the gateway (e.g., if the gateway IP is `169.254.15.1`, set the PC to `169.254.15.100`).  \n> **Image:** Setting IP address of the PC  \nIn this example, you can access the gateway on the `169.254.15.1` address.  \n5. In a web browser, enter the gateway's IP (e.g., `169.254.15.1`) to access the Web UI.\n6. Set the login password following the same rules as in [Wi-Fi mode](#wi-fi-ap-mode).\n7. After setting the password, the LoRaWAN Statistics page will load.\n8. Use the username `root` and your password for future logins."}
