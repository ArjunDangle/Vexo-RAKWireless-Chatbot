The setup of each RAK4200 can be done separately, but testing the LoRa P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously to a UART port (this could be one computer with 2 ports or 2 computers with one UART port each).  \n1. To set the RAK4200 to work in LoRa P2P mode, open the RAK Serial port tool and send the command, as shown in **Figure 54**: `at+set_config=lora:work_mode:1`.  \n> **Image:** RAK4200 setting to LoRa P2P mode  \n2. Configure the LoRa P2P parameters for both units. The command for setting the parameters has the format.\n`at+set_config=lorap2p:XXX:Y:Z:A:B:C`  \nThe parameters are as follows:  \n- XXX: Frequency in Hz.\n- Y: Spreading factor, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].\n- Z: Bandwidth, [0:125kHz, 1:250kHz, 2:500kHz]\n- A: Coding Rate, [1:4/5, 2:4/6, 3:4/7, 4:4/8]\n- B: Preamble Length, 5~65535.\n- C: Power in dBm, 5~20.  \nFor this example, the LoRa parameters are:  \n- Link frequency: 869525000Hz\n- Spreading factor: 7\n- Bandwidth: 125kHz\n- Coding Rate: 4/5\n- Preamble Length: 5\n- Power: 5dBm  \n3. It is translated into the following [RAK4200 AT command](at-command-manual) that is sent to both units, as shown in **Figure 55**:  \n`at+set_config=lorap2p:869525000:7:0:1:5:5`  \n> **Image:** Setting both RAK4200 units with the LoRa P2P parameters  \n4. Next, set the transmission mode of the module. In this example, Unit 1 is set to sender mode, and unit 2 is set to receiver mode by AT command. See **Figure 56**.  \nUnit 1(Sender): `at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:2`\nUnit 2(Receiver): `at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:1`  \n> **Image:** Set the module in the sender (left) and in the receiver (right) mode  \n5. To send a message with the string \u201c123456890\u201d from Unit 1 to Unit 2, use the command on Unit 1:  \n`at+send=lorap2p:1234567890`  \nThe message will be automatically received by Unit 2. See **Figure 57**.  \n> **Image:** Sending a message from RAK unit 1(left) to RAK unit 2 (right)"}
