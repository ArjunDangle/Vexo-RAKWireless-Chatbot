Five BOR thresholds are selectable through option bytes.  \nDuring power-on, BOR keeps the device under reset until the supply voltage VDD reaches the specified VBORx threshold:  \n\u2022 When VDD drops below the selected threshold, a device reset is generated.  \n\u2022 When VDD is above the VBORx upper limit, the device reset is released and the system can start.  \n- **PVD (Programmable Voltage Detector)**  \nThe module features an embedded programmable voltage detector (PVD) that monitors the VDD power supply and compares it with the VPVD threshold.  An interrupt is generated when VDD drops below the VPVD threshold or when VDD is higher than the VPVD threshold. The interrupt service routine can then generate a warning message or put the MCU into a safe state.  \nThe PVD is enabled by software and can be configured to monitor the VDD supply level needed for sub-GHz radio operation. For this, the PVD must select its lowest threshold, and the PVD and wakeup must be enabled by the EWPVD bit in the PWR_CR3 register. Only a voltage drop below the PVD level generates a wakeup event.  \n- **PVM (Peripheral Voltage Monitor)**  \nThe module features an embedded PVM (peripheral voltage monitor) that compares the independent supply voltage VDDA with a fixed threshold to ensure that the peripheral is within its functional supply range.  \n- **Radio End-Of-Life Monitor**  \nA radio end-of-life monitor provides information on the VDD supply when VDD is too low to operate the sub-GHz radio. When reaching the EOL level, the software must safely stop all activity."}

By default, the microcontroller is in Run mode, range 1, after a system or power-on reset.  It is up to the user to select one of the low-power modes described below:  \n- **Sleep Mode:**  \nCPU clock off; all peripherals, including CPU core peripherals (such as NVIC, SysTick), can run and wake the CPU when an interrupt or event occurs.  \n- **Low-Power Run Mode (LPRun):**  \nWhen the system clock frequency is reduced below 2MHz, the code is executed from the SRAM or the Flash memory. The regulator is in low-power mode to minimize the operating current.  \n- **Low-Power Sleep Mode (LPSleep):**  \nEntered from the LPRun mode.  \n- **Stop 0 and Stop 1 Modes:**  \nThe contents of SRAM1, SRAM2, and all registers are retained. All clocks in the VCORE domain are stopped. The PLL, MSI, HSI16, and HSE32 are disabled.  LSI and LSE may remain active. The RTC may remain active (Stop mode with RTC, Stop mode without RTC). The sub-GHz radio may remain active independently of the CPU. Some peripherals with wake-up capability may enable the HSI16 RC during Stop mode to detect their wake-up conditions.  \n- **Stop 1 Mode:**  \nStop 1 offers the largest number of active peripherals and wake-up sources, a smaller wake-up time, but higher consumption compared with Stop 2. In Stop 0 mode, the main regulator remains on, resulting in the fastest wake-up time but much higher consumption. The active peripherals and wake-up sources are the same as in Stop 1 mode, which uses the low-power regulator. When exiting Stop 0 or Stop 1 mode, the system clock can be either MSI up to 48MHz or HSI16, depending on the software configuration.  \n- **Stop 2 Mode:**  \nIn Stop 2 mode, part of the VCORE domain is powered off. Only SRAM1, SRAM2, the CPU, and some peripherals retain their contents. All clocks in the VCORE domain are stopped. The PLL, MSI, HSI16, and HSE32 are disabled.  \nLSI and LSE may remain active. The RTC may remain active (Stop 2 mode with RTC, Stop 2 mode without RTC). The sub-GHz radio may also remain active independently of the CPU. Some peripherals with wake-up capability may enable the HSI16 RC during Stop 2 mode to detect their wake-up condition.\nThe system clock, when exiting Stop 2 mode, may be either MSI (up to 48MHz) or HSI16, depending on the software configuration.  \n- **Standby Mode:**  \nThe VCORE domain is powered off. However, SRAM2 content can be preserved as follows:  \n\u2022 Standby mode with SRAM2 retention: Set the RRS bit in PWR control register 3 (PWR_CR3). SRAM2 is supplied by the low-power regulator.  Standby mode without SRAM2 retention: Clear the RRS bit in PWR_CR3. The main and low-power regulators are powered off. All VCORE domain clocks (PLL, MSI, HSI16, and HSE32) stop. LSI and LSE may remain active.  \n\u2022 The RTC may remain active (Standby mode with or without RTC). The sub-GHz radio and PVD may also remain active if enabled independently.  In Standby mode, the PVD uses its lowest level.  Upon exiting Standby mode, the system clock is MSI at 4 MHz.  \n- **Shutdown Mode:**  \nThe VCORE domain is powered off. All clocks in the VCORE domain are stopped. The PLL, MSI, HSI16, LSI, and HSE32 are disabled. The LSE can be kept running. The system clock when exiting shutdown mode is the MSI at 4MHz. In this mode, supply voltage monitoring is disabled, and product behavior is not guaranteed in case of a power voltage drop."}
