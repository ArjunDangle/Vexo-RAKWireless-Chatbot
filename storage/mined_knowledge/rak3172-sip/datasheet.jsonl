Using impedance simulation software is advisable to achieve this.\n- If using an external antenna connector, position it close to the `RF_OUT` pin.\n- Ground plane optimization is critical for certain antenna types, such as monopoles.\n- The GND trace used for the RF return path must be directly connected to the GND plane and not treated as a thermal relief.\n- It is recommended to route the RF trace in a curve, rather than with sharp 90-degree angles.  \nIn addition, with a commitment to making IoT easy, RAK offers a dedicated service for [Antenna RF Design](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/antenna-rf-design-service-including-pcb-design-tuning-matching-and-rf-test) which includes PCB design, tuning, matching, and RF testing.  \n| **Pin No.** | **Name**     | **Type** | **Description**                                                    |\n| :---------: | :----------: | :------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1           | PA13         | I        | Reserved -

Using impedance simulation software is advisable to achieve this.\n- If using an external antenna connector, position it close to the `RF_OUT` pin.\n- Ground plane optimization is critical for certain antenna types, such as monopoles.\n- The GND trace used for the RF return path must be directly connected to the GND plane and not treated as a thermal relief.\n- It is recommended to route the RF trace in a curve, rather than with sharp 90-degree angles.  \nIn addition, with a commitment to making IoT easy, RAK offers a dedicated service for [Antenna RF Design](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/antenna-rf-design-service-including-pcb-design-tuning-matching-and-rf-test) which includes PCB design, tuning, matching, and RF testing.  \n| **Pin No.** | **Name**     | **Type** | **Description**                                                    |\n| :---------: | :----------: | :------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1           | PA13         | I        | Reserved -
