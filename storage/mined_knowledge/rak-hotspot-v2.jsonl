The RAK2287 is essential to the device's functionality, providing all LoRaWAN connectivity. In addition, it sends and receives LoRa frames and handles signal modulation and demodulation.\n\nThe embedded host system, Raspberry Pi, is responsible for processing the LoRa frames and other high-level protocol-related tasks. After receiving and processing the LoRa frames, they are then sent to a LoRaWAN server.\n\n> **Image:** RAK Hotspot System Structure\n\n#### Block Diagram\n\nThe RAK Hotspot serves as the central hardware solution for all LoRa-based radio communication that receives and transmits radio messages. The embedded host system, Raspberry Pi, handles the processing of the LoRa frames and other high-level protocol-related tasks. Once the radio messages are received and processed, they are sent to a LoRaWAN server.\n\n> **Image:** RAK Hotspot Block Diagram\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThe detailed segmentation of protocol-related tasks is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\n### Hardware\n\n#### Interfaces\n\n> **Image:** RAK Hotspot Interfaces\n\n#### RF Characteristics\n\n##### Operating Frequencies\n\nThe RAK Hotspot supports all LoRaWAN frequency channels, including RU864, IN865, EU868, US915, AU915, KR920, and AS923. Configuring these channels is straightforward when building the firmware from the source code.\n\n##### LoRa RF Characteristics\n\n###### Transmitter RF Characteristics\n\nThe RAK Hotspot boasts excellent transmitter performance. It is highly recommended to utilize an optimized configuration for the power level configuration, which is part of the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). HAL ensures a consistent RF output power level and current consumption.\n\n| **PA Control** | **PWID Control** | **Power**   |\n| -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |\n| **0**          | 10               | -6 dBm |\n| **0**          | 13               | -3 dBm |\n| **0**          | 17               | 0 dBm  |\n| **0**          | 20               | 4 dBm  |\n| **1**          | 0                | 8 dBm  |\n| **1**          | 2                | 10 dBm |\n| **1**          | 4                | 12 dBm |\n| **1**          | 7                | 14 dBm |\n| **1**          | 9                | 16 dBm |\n| **1**          | 10               | 17 dBm |\n| **1**          | 12               | 19 dBm |\n| **1**          | 13               | 20 dBm |\n| **1**          | 16               | 23 dBm |\n| **1**          | 18               | 25 dBm |\n| **1**          | 20               | 26 dBm |\n| **1**          | 22               | 27 dBm |\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n- Usually, there's a ±1.5 dB variance between the actual test value and the data in the table.\n- If nothing else is stated, T=25 ℃, VDD=5 V (Typ.).\n\n\n| **Parameter**                              | **Condition**           | **Min**       | **Max**       |\n| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| **Frequency Range**                        | -                       | 863 MHz  | 870 MHz  |\n| **Modulation Techniques**                  | FSK/LoRa                | -             | -             |\n| **TX Frequency Variation vs. Temperature** | Power Level Setting: 20 | -3 kHz   | +3 kHz   |\n| **TX Power Variation vs. Temperature**     | Power Level Setting: 20 | -5 dBm   | +5 dBm   |\n| **TX Power Variation**                     | -                       | -1.5 dBm | +1.5 dBm |\n\n| **Parameter**             | **Condition** | **Min**      | **Max**      |\n| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |\n| **Frequency Range**       | -             | 902 MHz | 928 MHz |\n| **Modulation Techniques** | FSK/LoRa      | -            | -            |\n\n###### Receiver RF Characteristics\n\nIt is highly recommended to use optimized RSSI calibration values, which are part of HAL v3.1.

If the red LED flashes, it signifies a power supply issue. To resolve this, reconnect the power and check again.\n\n🟢 **Green LED**: When powered on, the green LED will blink randomly for approximately 5 seconds before stopping. If the green LED continues blinking repeatedly for an extended period, it typically indicates an issue, often with the SD card or potentially with the power supply.\n\nIn case the green LED continues blinking persistently, consider the following recommendations:\n\n1. Unplug the USB-C power cable.\n2. Remove the microSD card, verify its position, and reinsert it securely, ensuring it is properly seated. The card may have shifted during shipping or been inserted incorrectly, possibly upside down.\n3. Reconnect the USB-C power cable, ensuring it is securely plugged in all the way.\n","keywords":[],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak-hotspot-v2\\troubleshooting.md","token_count":0}
