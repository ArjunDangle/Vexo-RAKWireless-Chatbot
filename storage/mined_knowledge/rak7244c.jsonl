To learn more, refer to the ChirpStack [site](https://www.chirpstack.io/).\n\nWhen it comes to RAK7244C WisGate Developer D4+ Gateway, there are two (2) ways to use the ChirpStack:\n\n### Using the Built-In ChirpStack\n\nThere is a built-in ChirpStack in every RAK Developer gateway if you use the latest firmware or the `rak_common_for_gateway` repository.\n\n- When you use it for the first time after burning the latest firmware, the gateway will work in the **EU868 Band**, and it will use the built-in ChirpStack as its default LoRa Server. If you don't want to change the frequency or LoRa Server, you don't have to do anything as this will be configured automatically when the gateway boots.\n\n- However, if it is not the first time you use the gateway and you want to use the built-in ChirpStack as the LoRa Server, follow the steps discussed in the [Configuring the Gateway](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7244c/quickstart/#configuring-the-gateway) section.\n\n- **Optional** - If ever you disabled the **AP Mode** and you have connected it to your own Wi-Fi network **(Client Mode)**, you can search for your gateway’s IP Address via [Advanced IP Scanner](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/).\n\n- There is a **Web-based UI** that comes with the ChirpStack instance. Open a browser and enter the following credentials:\n\n    - **Browser Address**: `<Gateway IP address>:8080` (Example: `http://192.168.0.100:8080` )\n    - **Username**: admin\n    - **Password**: admin\n\n\n> **WARNING:** It is advisable to **change your password** to tighten the security of your account. You can change this by clicking the change password button at the user icon.\n\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack web-based UI\n\n- Everything should be pre-configured - **Device profiles** have been created, the gateway has been registered with the server, etc. If you go to the **Gateways tab** and click on **rak_gateway**, you should see the gateway details page.\n\n> **Image:** Available gateway in Chirpstack\n\n- Go to **Gateways** and see the **Last seen status**. It must be a few seconds ago, which signifies that the gateway is visible in the ChirpStack server.\n\n> **Image:** Last seen status\n\n### Using an Independent ChirpStack\n\nYou can setup an independent ChirpStack by yourself and can set a ChirpStack in AWS.

In this section, you will learn how to connect your gateway to an LTE network.\n\n1. Insert a SIM card of the appropriate type and size into the SIM card slot. Power on the gateway.\n2. Log into the gateway through SSH, and enter the following command:\n\n   ```\n   sudo gateway-config\n   ```\n\n3. In the main configuration menu, choose **7 Configure LTE Module**.\n\n> **Image:** Configure LTE module\n\nTwo configuration options are available for your LTE.\n\n1. **Enable LTE Automatic Dial-up** - the default option and is used to enable automatic connection during start-up.\n2. **Disable LTE Automatic Dial-up** - used to disable automatic connection during start-up.\n\n> **Image:** LTE configuration options\n\n3. Next, you need to configure the LTE network operator’s information. Make sure to disable the automatic connection on the start-up feature before starting.\n\n4. Execute the command below in the console to start the minicom tool:\n\n   ```\n   sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyAMA0 -b 115200\n   ```\n\n> **Image:** Minicom tool\n\n5. Then, try entering the command **at** in the tool. If it returns with **OK**, it means you have opened the serial port successfully.\n\n> **Image:** AT Command in Minicom\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nIf you cannot see the `at`, which you just entered. Try to hold `CTRL+A`, then press `Z`, then `E`. This should allow you to go to the command entering mode.\n\n\n6. Next, execute the AT command `at+cops=?` to look for all available LTE networks in range.\n\n> **Image:** AT Command for LTE network query\n\nThis may take a couple of seconds. After that, you'll see the available LTE network information similar to **Figure 39**.\n\n> **Image:** LTE network example\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n**Figure 39** shows the available LTE network in China. This information may vary depending on the available network in your region. For instance, in China, the available network are `CHINA MOBILE`, `CHN-UNICOM`, or `CHN-CT`.\n\n\n7. Next, execute the AT command below to set the information of the LTE network operator that you want to use.\n\n- **XXX** - this parameter is set to describe the network operator. For example, `CHINA MOBILE`, `CHN-UNICOM`, or `CHN-CT`.\n- **YYY** - this parameter is set as the last value of every operator. Choose the network with 0 value as this is the currently used network.\n\nNow, take this LTE network in Europe (Bulgaria) as an example:\n\n> **Image:** Sample LTE Networks in EU\n\nThen, using the sample AT command described above, the command will be:\n\n> **Image:** Sample AT Command for LTE network\n\nLastly, you will receive `OK`, which means you have successfully configured the LTE network.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nTo exit Minicom, press `Enter`, `Ctrl + A` then press `Q`. A pop-up will appear and choose **Yes**.\n\n\n8. Proceed to set the **APN name** for the **pppd** process. From the main configuration menu, choose **6 Configure APN name**.\n\n> **Image:** Configure APN name\n\n9. Then, you will see the window option below where you can change the APN Name or retain its default name.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nIf you want to modify the APN Name, make sure it is a real and valid APN Name.\n\n\n> **Image:** APN name\n\n10. Lastly, set the baud rate. The default value is `115200`.\n\n> **Image:** Baud rate setting\n\nYou have now finished configuring your LTE network. Now, you can test and verify the connection as follows:\n\nExecute the following command in the terminal:\n\n```\nsudo pppd call gprs\n```\n\nThere will be a series of logs. After that, you will see the following information at the end of the log.\n\n> **Image:** IP address Information\n\nYou will be assigned with an IP address (local and remote) along with the DNS addresses. Having this information signifies that your connection has been  successfully established.\n\nAlso, do not forget to re-enable the automatic LTE connection on startup\n\n> **Image:** Enabling the automatic LTE connection during start-Up\n\n","keywords":["LoRa","TTN","ChirpStack","LTE","RAK7244C"],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7244c\\quickstart.md","token_count":0}
