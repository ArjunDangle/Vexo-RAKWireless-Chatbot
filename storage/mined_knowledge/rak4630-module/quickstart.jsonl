After the configuration, click **Save & Apply** to proceed with the application's setup.  \n> **Image:** Adding Application to the LoRaWAN network server  \n6. Another essential parameter in a LoRaWAN application is the **Application Key**, utilized in **OTAA** activation. While you can manually add one, it's advisable to let the network server generate it by clicking the generate icon button. Additionally, you can add a description to your application. Once you have the **Application Key**, click **Save & Apply**.  \n> **Image:** Configure Application Key  \n7. The new application will now be added to the application list of your network server. To register the RAK4630 WisDuo module as a device in that application, click edit to access the application console.  \n> **Image:** Access the LoRaWAN Application Console  \n8. Add the device EUI (DEVEUI) on the application console. This must be unique, and it is highly encouraged that you use the **DEVEUI** printed on the sticker of your RAK4630 module. Then click the **Add** button to proceed with the next configurations.  \n> **Image:** Adding device to the application  \n9. Put a name on your device, in this case, **RAK4630**. Three parameters in this list must be the same as your RAK4630 code: **Class**, **Join Mode**, and **Application Key**.  \nIn the Arduino code example in the latter part of this guide, Class A and Join Mode OTAA are the default. With that, you will only need to modify the code of the application key. Lastly, the **LoRaWAN MAC Version** must be **1.0.3**. After setting up all these parameters, click **Save & Apply**.  \n> **Image:** Configuration of the RAK4630 as OTAA device  \n10. The device will now be shown as a device in your application. The next step is to prepare the RAK4630 WisDuo module so that it can match all the parameters in the network server.  \n> **Image:** RAK4630 registered on the network server"}
