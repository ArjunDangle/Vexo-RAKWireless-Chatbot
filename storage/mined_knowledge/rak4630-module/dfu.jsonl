Connect the RAK4630 via USB and check if the port is detected in Device Manager.  In this guide, it is detected as COM32. The COM port number may vary depending on the PC. If no port appears in Device Manager, try double-clicking the reset button and checking again.  \n> **Image:** Checking COM Port via Device Manager  \n4. After that, send the `AT+BOOT` command to the device via serial terminal software. Follow the [guide on using Tera Term from the RAK4631-R documentation](#how-to-check-firmware-version-using-tera-term), but instead of checking the firmware version, input `AT+BOOT`. You will see no reply as the module will restart; it will then be momentarily disconnected before re-establishing the connection to Tera Term.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\nDisconnect teh device from TeraTerm/Serial Terminal software or close it to free the COM port before the firmware update.  Otherwise, errors may occur during the update.  \n> **WARNING:** **Recovery Mode**  \nIf `AT+BOOT` cannot be sent to the device, you can enable DFU mode via the UART2_TX pin. Connect the UART2_TX pin to GND, then reset the device to enter DFU mode.  Proceed to the next step and upload the firmware without the `AT+BOOT` command.  \n> **Image:** AT+BOOT to Initialize Boot Mode  \n5. After initiating Boot mode, execute the firmware update. Open the command prompt and navigate to the `RAK4631-R Update` folder. This folder contains the nRFutil and the latest firmware.  Input `cd C:/RAK4631-R Update/` followed by `nrfutil.exe dfu serial -pkg RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip -p COM32`. Ensure you have the correct `.zip` file name and `COM port number` to avoid errors.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\nChange the COM port number in the command to match your PC.  In this example, it is COM32, but it may differ on your PC.  \n> **Image:** FW Update Using nRFutil  \n6. Check if the firmware successfully updated using the `AT+VER=?` command. Follow the [guide on using Tera Term from the RAK4631-R documentation](#how-to-check-firmware-version-using-tera-term) to check the firmware version and confirm the device update.  \n> **Image:** RAK4631-R Latest Firmware Version Check"}
