You can send AT commands and upload custom firmware via UART or wirelessly via BLE. The AT commands in RAK11720 are still available even if you compile custom firmware via RUI3, and you also have the option to disable them."}

The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliance and interoperability. This project is actively maintained by [The Things Industries](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/).  \nLoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide-area networks. It allows large-scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with internet-connected applications over long-range wireless connections.  \nThe RAK11720 WisDuo module can be part of this ecosystem as a device, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to The Things Stack using the LoRaWAN protocol.
