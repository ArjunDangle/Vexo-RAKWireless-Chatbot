The RAK2287 is an essential part of it as it provides all LoRaWAN connectivity. It receives and transmits LoRa Frames and takes care of modulating/demodulating the signals among others. The processing of the LoRa Frames as well as higher-level protocol-related tasks is done by the embedded host system (Raspberry Pi). Received and processed LoRa Frames are being sent to a LoRaWAN Server. The segmentation of protocol-related tasks is outside the scope of this document.\n\n> **Image:** RAK7248 System Structure\n\n> **Image:** RAK7248C System Structure\n\n> **Image:** RAK7248P System Structure\n\n#### Block Diagram\n\nRAK7248 is the central hardware solution for all LoRa based radio communication. It receives and transmits radio messages. The processing of radio messages as well as the protocol related tasks is done by the embedded host system (Raspberry Pi4). Received and processed radio messages are being sent to a LoRaWAN server.

Learn more about [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/).\n\nWhen it comes to RAK7248/RAK7248C/RAK7248P WisGate Developer D4H Gateway, there are two (2) ways to use the ChirpStack:\n\n### Using the Built-in ChirpStack\n\nThere is a built-in ChirpStack in every RAK Developer gateway if you use the latest firmware or `rak_common_for_gateway` repository.\n\nWhen you use it for the first time after burning the latest firmware, the gateway will work in the **EU868 Band**, and it will use the built-in ChirpStack as its default LoRa Server. If you don't want to change the frequency or LoRa Server, you don't have to do anything as this will be configured automatically when the gateway boots.\n\nHowever, if it is not the first time you use the gateway and you want to use the built-in ChirpStack as the LoRa Server, follow the steps discussed in [**Configuring the Gateway**](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7248/quickstart/#configuring-the-gateway) section.\n\n  - **Optional** - If ever you disabled the **AP Mode** and you have connected it to your Wifi network **(Client Mode)**, you can search for your gateway’s IP Address via [Advanced IP Scanner](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/).\n\nThere is a **Web-based UI** that comes with the ChirpStack instance. Simply open a browser and enter the following credentials:\n\n - **Browser Address**: `<Gateway IP address>:8080` (Example: [http://192.168.0.100:8080](http://192.168.0.100:8080))\n - **Username**: admin\n - **Password**: admin\n\n\n> **WARNING:** It is recommended to **change your password** to tighten the security of your account. You can change this by clicking the change password button at the user icon.\n\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack web-based UI\n\nEverything should be pre-configured - **Device profiles** have been created, the gateway has been registered with the server, etc. If you go to the **Gateways tab** and click **rak_gateway**, you should see the gateway details page.\n\n> **Image:** Available gateways in ChirpStack\n\nGo to **Gateways** and see the **Last seen status**. It must be a few seconds ago, which signifies that the gateway is visible in the ChirpStack server.\n\n> **Image:** Last seen status\n\n### Using an Independent ChirpStack\n\nYou can setup an independent ChirpStack by yourself and can set a ChirpStack in AWS. Refer to the [AWS guide](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN/). If you want to run ChirpStack on a different host/cloud, then refer to the [guide](https://www.chirpstack.io/guides/debian-ubuntu/) on the ChirpStack site.\n\n\n> **WARNING:** Remember to run the `sudo gateway-config` command in the CLI and point the gateway to the IP address of the machine you just installed ChirpStack on. This can be done in item 2 in the menu **Setup RAK Gateway LoRa concentrator**.\n\n\nAssuming you have set it up correctly, log in to your ChirpStack to register your gateway by opening the ChirpStack's web page in a browser by entering:\n\n  - **Browser Address**: `<IP Address of ChirpStack>:8080`\n  - **Username**: admin\n  - **Password**: admin\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack login page\n\nClick **Gateways** and select **+ CREATE** to register your gateway.\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack registered gateways\n\n> **Image:** Registering your gateway\n\nAfter registering your gateway, fill in the necessary information.\n\n> **Image:** Filling in the details\n\nFill in the gateway ID you got from the [Configuring the Gateway](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7248/quickstart/#configuring-the-gateway) section, also called gateway EUI.\n\nIf you have properly configured your gateway and there is a network connection between the external ChirpStack and your gateway, you should see the same page and status.\n\n> **Image:** Successfully registered gateway\n\nCongratulations! You have now successfully connected your gateway to an external ChirpStack!\n","keywords":["ChirpStack","LoRaWAN Network Server","RAK7248","WisGate Developer D4H Gateway","Built-in ChirpStack","Independent ChirpStack","Gateway Configuration"],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7248\\lorawan-network-server-guide.md","token_count":0}

It can receive up to **8 LoRa packets** with different spreading factors on different channels and is available in multiple variants so it can be used for international standard bands. This unique capability allows implementing innovative network architectures advantageous over other short-range systems. **RAK2287 Pi HAT** is a converter board a with Raspberry Pi form factor that enables the RAK2287 module to be mounted on top of the Raspberry Pi. It integrates one (1) 40-pin female Pi HAT connector and one mPCIe connector to connect RAK2287 (RAK9003 in PoE variant/RAK2013 in Cellular variant) to the Raspberry Pi 4.\n\nRAK7248 is ideal for prototyping, proof-of-concept demonstrations, or evaluation. It includes a ready-to-use LoRaWAN Gateway OS that can be connected to a LoRaWAN server. Also, it is developer-friendly and simple even for not-so-tech users to set up a LoRaWAN system. It has to be the best value and function for connectivity to address a variety of applications like Smart Grid, Intelligent Farm, and other IoT enterprise applications.\n","keywords":[],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7248\\overview.md","token_count":0}
