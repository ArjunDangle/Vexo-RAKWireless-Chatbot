It is advisable to use impedance simulation software tools to achieve this requirement.\n- If using an external antenna connector, place it close to the `RF` pin.\n- Ground plane optimization is critical for certain antenna types, such as monopoles.\n- GND traces used for RF path return must be directly connected to the GND plane and not treated as thermal reliefs.\n- It is recommended that RF traces be routed in a curve rather than at a sharp 90degrees.  \nIn addition, with a commitment to making IoT easy, RAK offers a dedicated service for [Antenna RF Design](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/antenna-rf-design-service-including-pcb-design-tuning-matching-and-rf-test) which includes PCB design, tuning, matching, and RF testing.  \n| **Pin No.** | **Name**      | **Type** | **Description**                                                                                   |\n| ----------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1           | PA3/UART2_RX  | I        | Reserved -

It is advisable to use impedance simulation software tools to achieve this requirement.\n- If using an external antenna connector, place it close to the `RF` pin.\n- Ground plane optimization is critical for certain antenna types, such as monopoles.\n- GND traces used for RF path return must be directly connected to the GND plane and not treated as thermal reliefs.\n- It is recommended that RF traces be routed in a curve rather than at a sharp 90degrees.  \nIn addition, with a commitment to making IoT easy, RAK offers a dedicated service for [Antenna RF Design](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/antenna-rf-design-service-including-pcb-design-tuning-matching-and-rf-test) which includes PCB design, tuning, matching, and RF testing.  \n| **Pin No.** | **Name**      | **Type** | **Description**                                                                                   |\n| ----------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1           | PA3/UART2_RX  | I        | Reserved -

It is advisable to use impedance simulation software tools to achieve this requirement.\n- If using an external antenna connector, place it close to the `RF` pin.\n- Ground plane optimization is critical for certain antenna types, such as monopoles.\n- GND traces used for RF path return must be directly connected to the GND plane and not treated as thermal reliefs.\n- It is recommended that RF traces be routed in a curve rather than at a sharp 90degrees.  \nIn addition, with a commitment to making IoT easy, RAK offers a dedicated service for [Antenna RF Design](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/antenna-rf-design-service-including-pcb-design-tuning-matching-and-rf-test) which includes PCB design, tuning, matching, and RF testing.  \n| **Pin No.** | **Name**      | **Type** | **Description**                                                                                   |\n| ----------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1           | PA3/UART2_RX  | I        | Reserved -
