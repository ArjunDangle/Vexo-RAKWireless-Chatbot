Click on Device profiles in the menu then click **Add device profile**  \n> **Image:** Adding device profile  \nIn the **Add device profile** page, you have several tabs. For this tutorial, it is sufficient to fill out the information in the **General** tab.  \n> **Image:** Filling Parameters of an Application  \n- Name\n- Enter a unique name for this device profile. Here I have choosen **RAK-Cayenne-LPP-AS923-3**\n- Region & Region configuration\n- Select the LoRaWAN region that your device and gateway is using. Here we use AS923-3\n- MAC version\n- Enter the LoRaWAN MAC version. LoRaWAN 1.0.3 will work, even if the device is only supporting V1.0.2\n- Regional parameters revision\n- Choose RP002-1.0.3\n- Expected uplink interval\n- Enter here the 2 times the interval that the RAK10702 will send data. Chirpstack will mark the device as disconnected if no data was received within this value\n- Device-status request frequency (req/day)\n- If you want to check the device status from the server side, enter the number of check requests per day. Here we chose 12, which means Chirpstack will request a device status every 2 hours.\nThe other settings can be left as given.  \nPush the **Submit** button.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE  \nChirpstack can use a payload decoder to show the payload in the device events. You can find a matching decoder for the RAK10702 in our [GitHub repo \u2934\ufe0f](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless_Standardized_Payload).  \nAdding the payload decoder is not difficult.

Here we use AS923-3\n- MAC version\n- Enter the LoRaWAN MAC version. LoRaWAN 1.0.3 will work, even if the device is only supporting V1.0.2\n- Regional parameters revision\n- Choose RP002-1.0.3\n- Expected uplink interval\n- Enter here the 2 times the interval that the RAK10702 will send data. Chirpstack will mark the device as disconnected if no data was received within this value\n- Device-status request frequency (req/day)\n- If you want to check the device status from the server side, enter the number of check requests per day. Here we chose 12, which means Chirpstack will request a device status every 2 hours.\nThe other settings can be left as given.  \nPush the **Submit** button.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE  \nChirpstack can use a payload decoder to show the payload in the device events. You can find a matching decoder for the RAK10702 in our [GitHub repo \u2934\ufe0f](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless_Standardized_Payload).  \nAdding the payload decoder is not difficult. From our [GitHub repo \u2934\ufe0f](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless_Standardized_Payload) open the [RAKwireless_Standardized_Payload.js](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless_Standardized_Payload/blob/main/RAKwireless_Standardized_Payload.js) Javascript.  \n> **Image:** Filling Parameters of an Application  \nIn Chirpstack, in the Device Profile, go to the tab Codec.\nSelect in the **Payload codec** tab the _**JavaScript functions**_  \nCopy the content of the [RAKwireless_Standardized_Payload.js \u2934\ufe0f](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless_Standardized_Payload/blob/main/RAKwireless_Standardized_Payload.js) Javascript and paste it in the **Codec functions** field. Make sure to overwrite any example code that is already there.  \nThen press the **Submit** button.  \n> **Image:** Filling Parameters of an Application"}
