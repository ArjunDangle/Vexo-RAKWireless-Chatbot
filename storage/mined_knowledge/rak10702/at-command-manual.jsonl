In general, the AT Command starts with the prefix `AT` and ends with `<CR><LF>` (i.e. `\\r\\n`). For the rest of the manual, the `\\r\\n` part is omitted for the sake of clarity.  \nThe AT commands have the standard format `AT+XXX` with `XXX` denoting the command.  \nThere are four available command formats:  \n| **AT COMMAND FORMAT**      | **Description**                                   |\n| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| `AT+XXX?`                  | Provides a short description of the given command |\n| `AT+XXX=?`                 | Reading the current value on the command          |\n| `AT+XXX=<input parameter>` | Writing configuration on the command              |\n| `AT+XXX`                   | Used to run a command                             |  \nThe output of the commands is returned via UART.  \nThe format of the reply is divided into two parts: **returned value** and the **status return code**.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE  \n`<CR>` stands for **carriage return** and `<LF>` stands for **line feed**.  \n1. **`<value><CR><LF>`** is the first reply when **`AT+XXX?`** command description or **`AT+XXX=?`** reading value is executed, then it will be followed by the status return code. The formats with no return value like **`AT+XXX=<input parameter>`** writing configuration command and **`AT+XXX`** run command will just reply to the status return code.  \n2. **`<CR><LF><STATUS><CR><LF>`** is the second part of the reply, which is the status return code.  \nThe possible status codes are:  \n| **STATUS RETURN CODE** | **Description**                              |\n| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| `OK`                   | Command executed correctly without error.    |\n| `+CME ERROR:1`         | Generic error or input is not supported.     |\n| `+CME ERROR:2`         | Command not allowed.                         |\n| `+CME ERROR:5`         | The input parameter of the command is wrong. |\n| `+CME ERROR:6`         | The parameter is too long.                   |\n| `+CME ERROR:8`         | Value out of range.                          |  \nMore details on each command description and examples are given in the remainder of this section."}
