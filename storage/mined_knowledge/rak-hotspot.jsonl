The RAK2287 is a vital component, providing all LoRaWAN connectivity. It manages the reception and transmission of LoRa frames and handles signal modulation and demodulation, among other tasks.\n\nHigher-level protocol functions and LoRa frame processing are carried out by the embedded host system (Raspberry Pi). Processed LoRa frames are then forwarded to a LoRaWAN server. The detailed segmentation of protocol-related tasks is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n> **Image:** RAK Hotspot System Structure\n\n#### Block Diagram\n\nThe RAK Hotspot receives and transmits radio messages. The embedded host system (Raspberry Pi 4) handles the processing of these messages and the associated protocol tasks. Processed radio messages are then sent to a Helium LoRaWAN server.

Through a system called Proof-of-Coverage, RAK Hotspots earn more Helium when they are within range of other RAK Hotspots, provided they are at least 300 meters apart.\n\nThe range depends on the environment: in rural areas, it can reach **up to 10 miles or more**, while in dense urban areas, it is typically **up to a mile**. A single RAK Hotspot earns less because it can only issue Challenges over the internet and cannot participate in Proof-of-Coverage.\n\n![wireless-coverage](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisgate/rak-hotspot/icons/wireless-coverage.png)\n\n- Provide coverage across many square miles with a single RAK Hotspot.\n- Based on initial testing, only about 50 to 100 RAK Hotspots are needed to provide complete\ncoverage for an entire city.\n\n![connect-anything](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisgate/rak-hotspot/icons/connect-anything.png)\n\n- Create a new global network for billions of devices\n- Any IoT device can be made Helium-enabled using readily available off-the-shelf hardware components, software, and an open-source reference design that anyone can enhance.\n","keywords":[],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak-hotspot\\overview.md","token_count":0}

You can manually search it or just scan the QR Code provided below:\n* [**Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helium.wallet)\n* [**iOS:**](https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/helium-hotspot/id1450463605)\n\n> **Image:** QR Codes\n\n> **Image:** iOS and Android App\n\n### Power on the RAK Hotspot\n\n\n> **WARNING:** Before powering on, the best advice to follow the guidelines below to avoid damaging the RAK Hotspot. Familiarize the interfaces of the product as shown in the  [Interfaces](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak-hotspot/datasheet/#interfaces) section of the RAK Hotspot Datasheet.\n\n\n1. Attach the LoRa Antenna.\n\n2. When you are ready to setup your RAK Hotspot, plug in and connect the included power supply to the USB-C port on the RAK Hotspot. After 30 seconds, the device should be ready to configure via the app.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nFrom powering up the device, you only have 5 minutes to complete the setup. After 5 minutes, the app will no longer pair with the RAK Hotspot. In that case, you need to turn it off and turn it back on to try again.\n\n\n#### Account Security\n\nDuring the setup of your account, you will be asked to input 12 words that must be used in order to recover or move accounts between phones.\n\n> **Image:** Account recovery or transfer keywords\n\n### Backup your microSD Card\n\nBacking up your microSD Card is very important as this contains your RAK Hotspot identity. If the card is lost or damaged, you may lose access to the Helium network, and require payment of a new add gateway fee. **Keep this backup card in a safe place**.\n\nYou should only backup after adding the hotspot to your Helium account, and ideally once it has fully synced.\n\nTo backup, power off the RAK Hotspot and follow [backup instructions](backup).","keywords":[],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak-hotspot\\quickstart.md","token_count":0}

During normal operation, only a solid red light should be visible. A flashing red light signals an issue with the power supply—reconnect the power and check again.\n\n🟢 **Green LED**:\nWhen powered on, the green LED will blink in a random pattern for about 5 seconds before stopping. If the green LED continues blinking repeatedly for an extended period, it typically indicates a problem, usually with the SD card or possibly a power issue.\n\nIf the green LED blinks constantly, refer to the following recommendations:\n\n1. Unplug USB-C power.\n2. Remove the microSD card, inspect it, and reinsert it, ensuring it is properly seated. The card may have shifted during shipping, or it might have been inserted incorrectly, such as upside down, after the backup process.\n3.
