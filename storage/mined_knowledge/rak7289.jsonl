Make sure to manually set the address of your PC to one in the same network (for example 169.254.15.100). \n\n3. To do this, open the head to the **Ethernet Properties** and click the **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.\n\n> **Image:** Internet properties\n\n1. Select **Use the following IP address** and set the IP address (for this example to `169.254.15.100`).\n\n> **Image:** Setting IP address of the PC\n\nIn this example, you can access the gateway on the `169.254.15.1` address. \n\n5. Use the same steps and credentials for the Web UI as for AP mode.\n\n### Access the Internet\n\n#### Connect Through WI-FI\n\n> **Image:** Accessing the Internet using Wi-Fi\n\n1. Access the gateway's Web UI. Navigate to **Network** > **Wi-Fi**. Make sure the wireless network is enabled. \n\n> **Image:** Wi-Fi settings\n\n2. From the drop-down **Mode** menu choose **Client** (or **Access Point + Client** if you want to see the gateway's AP). \n3. You can either click the **Scan** button to choose your **ESSID** or manually type the ESSID of the network in the provided field.\n4.  Select the right **Encryption** method and enter the correct **Key**.\n\n> **Image:** Enable client Wi-Fi interface\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n\nAssuming you have entered the correct parameter values, you should get an IP address assigned by your Wi-Fi router's (AP) built-in DHCP server. You can use this new IP address to log in via a web browser (the same way as in AP mode).\n\n\n#### Connect Through Ethernet/PoE\n\n> **Image:** Accessing the Internet through Ethernet\n\n1. Connect the Ethernet cable to the port marked **ETH** on the gateway and the other end to the PoE port of the PoE injector. \n\n2. Connect the LAN port of the PoE injector to your router. The router's DHCP server should assign an IP Address to the gateway. \n\n3. Now, you can access the assigned IP to access the gateway.\n\n","keywords":[],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7289\\quickstart.md","token_count":0}
