As described in the ChirpStack website:  \n\u201cChirpStack provides open-source components for LoRaWAN networks. Together they form a ready-to-use solution including a user-friendly web interface for device management and APIs for integration. The modular architecture makes it possible to integrate within existing infrastructures. All components are licensed under the MIT license and can be used for commercial purposes.\u201d  \n> **Image:** RAK4600 Breakout Board in the context of the ChirpStack platform  \nThe architecture of the ChirpStack platform is shown in **Figure 43**. Similar to the case of TTN, the RAK4600 Breakout Board is located in the periphery and will transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRa gateway. For a more technical understanding of the ChirpStack components, refer to its [Architecture](https://www.chirpstack.io/project/architecture/) page.  \n* This document assumes that you are using a **RAK Gateway** with its built-in **ChirpStack** or the **RAK Cloud Testing ChirpStack**. Additionally, ensure that the RAK Gateway with ChirpStack is successfully configured.
