It also includes the block diagram and the system diagram of the module.\n\n#### Board Overview\n\n> **Image:** RAK813 Board Dimensions\n\n#### Block Diagram\n\nThe short-range technology nRF52832 (BLE) is paired with the Semtech's SX127x (LoRa) chipset making the RAK813 capable of long-distance wireless communication.\n\n> **Image:** RAK813 Block Diagram\n\n#### System Diagram\n\n> **Image:** System Diagram\n\n### Hardware\n\nThe hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It discusses the pinouts of the module and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical, environmental, and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK813 Module.\n\n#### Pin Definition\n\n> **Image:** Pin Out Diagram for RAK813\n\n\n> **WARNING:** When using `LORA_ANT` and `BLE_ANT` pins for antenna and not the IPEX connector variant, there are design considerations to make sure optimum RF performance.\n\n- RF trace must be away from interference (switching node of DC-DC supply, high current/voltage pulses from controllers of inductive load like motor, signal generators, etc.)\n- RF trace must have 50 Ohms impedance. It is advisable to use an impedance simulation software tool to achieve this requirement.\n- If using an external antenna connector, make it close to the `LORA_ANT` and `BLE_ANT` pins.\n- Ground plane optimization is critical on certain antenna types like monopole.\n- GND trace used for RF path return must be directly connected to the GND plane and not be treated as thermal relief.\n- It is recommended for the RF trace to be routed in a curve and not in a sharp 90 degrees.\n\nIn addition, with a commitment to making IoT easy, RAK offers a dedicated service for [Antenna RF Design](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/antenna-rf-design-service-including-pcb-design-tuning-matching-and-rf-test) which includes PCB design, tuning, matching, and RF testing.\n\n\n| Pin
