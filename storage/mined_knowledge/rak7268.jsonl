Optionally, you can use your own **PoE cable** and **injector** since the device supports PoE.\n\n#### Casing and Ports\n\n> **Image:** RAK7268/C WisGte Edge Lite 2 Top View\n\n> **Image:** RAK7268/C WisGate Edge Lite 2 Back Panel\n\n#### Status LED Indicators\n\n| LEDs | Status Indication Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| PWR LED | Power indicator - The LED is on when the device powered. |\n| Breathing LED | Breathing after system is up |\n| ETH LED | ON - Link is up |\n| ETH LED | OFF - Link is down |\n| ETH LED | Flicker - Ongoing data transfer |\n| LoRa LED | ON - LoRa is up |\n| LoRa LED | OFF - LoRa is down |\n| LoRa LED | Flicker - Ongoing data transfer |\n| WLAN LED | AP Mode: |\n| WLAN LED | - ON - The AP is up |\n| WLAN LED | - OFF - The AP is down |\n| WLAN LED | - Flicker - Ongoing data transfer |\n| WLAN LED | STA Mode: |\n| WLAN LED | - Slow flicker (1 Hz) - Disconnected |\n| WLAN LED | - ON - Connected |\n| WLAN LED | - Flicker - Ongoing data transfer |\n| LTE LED (will light up only on RAK7268C) | Slow flicker (1800 ms High / 200 ms Low) - Network searching |\n| LTE LED (will light up only on RAK7268C) | Slow flicker (200 ms High / 1800 ms Low) - Idle |\n| LTE LED (will light up only on RAK7268C) | Fast flicker (125 ms High / 125 ms Low) - Ongoing data transfer |\n\n#### Reset Key Functions\n\nThe functions of the **Reset** key are as follows:\n\n1. **Short press** - Restarts the gateway.\n2. **Long press (5 seconds and above)** - Restores factory settings.\n\n### Access the Gateway\n\nIn this section, several ways of accessing the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose from depending on the availability of the requirements needed.\n\n\n> **WARNING:** Do not power the device if the LoRa Antenna port has been left open to avoid potential damage to the RAK7268/RAK7268C WisGate Edge Lite 2.\n\n\n#### Wi-Fi AP Mode\n\nBy default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode which means that you can find an SSID named **RAK7268_XXXX** on your PC's Wi-Fi Network List. **XXXX** is the last two bytes of the gateway's MAC address.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n No password is required to connect via Wi-Fi\n\n\nUsing your preferred Web browser, log in with the credentials provided below:\n\n- **Browser Address**: 192.168.230.1\n- **Username**: root\n- **Password**: root\n\n#### WAN Port (Ethernet)\n\nConnect the Ethernet cable to the port marked ETH on the gateway and the other end to the PoE port of the PoE injector. Connect the LAN port of the PoE injector to your PC.\n\nThe default IP is **169.254.X.X.** The last two segments (X.X) are mapped from the last four bits of the MAC address of your gateway.\n\nFor example, the last four bits of the MAC address are 0F:01, and the IP address is 169.254.15.1. Make sure to manually set the address of your PC to one in the same network (for example 169.254.15.100). Use the same credentials for the Web UI as for AP mode.\n\n> **Image:** Web UI Login Page\n\n### Access the Internet\n\n#### Connect through Wi-Fi\n\nGo into the **Network>Wi-Fi** menu and make sure to select **Client** in the **Mode** field. Enter or click \"**Scan**\" to choose your **ESSID**, select the right **Encryption** method and enter the correct **Key**.\n\n> **Image:** Connect through Wi-Fi Credentials\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nAssuming you have entered the correct parameter values you should get an IP address assigned by your Wi-Fi router's (AP) built-in DHCP server. You can use this new IP address to log in via a web browser (same way as in AP mode).\n\n\n#### Connect through Ethernet\n\nConnect the one end of the Ethernet cable to the Ethernet on the Gateway and the other end to your router. The router’s DHCP server should assign an IP Address to the Gateway. You can change the default settings below if you wish (Full details in the [WisGateOS User Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/software-apis-and-libraries/wisgateos/overview/#overview)).\n\n> **Image:** Connect through Ethernet Settings\n\n","keywords":[],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7268\\quickstart.md","token_count":0}
