By default the port is 514.\n- **Log output level**: You can select what type of log output you want to save Debug, Info, Notice, Warning, Error, Critical, Alert, or Emergency.\n- **Cron Log Level**:  This is the level of the cron log: **Normal**, **Debug**, or **Warning**.  \n> **Image:** Logging Tab  \n- **Language**: In this tab, you can change the language of the Web UI. From the drop-down menu, you can choose a preferred language and click on **Save & Apply** to set the new language. Default (**auto**) is English.  \n> **Image:** Language Tab  \n- **Time Synchronization**\n- **Enable NTP client**: Enables/disables the NTP (Network Time Protocol) client for the clock synchronization.\n- **Provide NTP Server**: When enabled, you can set NTP servers in the **NTP server candidates** to synchronize the gateway\u2019s clock.\n- **Breathing light** (field that is present only for RAK7268 WisGate Edge Lite 2)  - This page allows you to control the status light on some of the gateways. It has three (3) options for working modes that you can select from a dropdown menu:  \n- **All**: In this mode, you get an option to set **Normal Light** and **Abnormal light**.\n- The **Normal light** have a parameter color, where you can choose between red, green and blue, as well as frequency, where the options are slow,fast and steady.\n- For **Abnormal light**, you can set color only.  In this mode, the light on the gateway will use settings for **Normal Light** until a **warning** appear, then switch to **Abnormal light**.\n- **Warning Only**:  In this mode, you can set **Abnormal Light** only, which will start blinking as soon as **warning** appears.\n- **Disable**:  The light will be off regardless of **warning**.\n- **warning**: in terms of this tool warnings cold occur  either due to no internet connection or packet forwarder issues.  \n> **Image:** Breathing Light Page"}
