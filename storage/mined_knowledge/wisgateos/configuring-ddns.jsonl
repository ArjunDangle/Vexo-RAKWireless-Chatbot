If everything is configured correctly, the user will be able to access the gateway via the name of the subdomain in the list of the added subdomains in the DDNS provider.  \n> **Image:** Name of the Subdomain  \n> **Image:** Accessing the Gateway via the Domain Name", "keywords": ["DDNS", "Dynamic Domain Name System", "gateway access", "configuration", "afraid.org"], "source_file": "configuring-ddns.md", "token_count": 0, "parent_content": "This guide discusses on how to configure the Dynamic Domain Name System Service to access the gateway.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE  \nIf the gateway is behind a router, you need to implement the Port Forwarding or Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). For example, if the router has assigned IP 192.168.0.125, allow the DMZ on that IP. It is recommended to change the default password of the gateway when DMZ is allowed for security reasons, as the gateway is exposed to the Internet.  \nIn using Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS), you can assign a domain name that you have linked to your gateway\u2019s dynamic IP address. This allows you to access your gateway with a domain name that is static. It will also not change even if a new IP address is assigned to the gateway making sure they don\u2019t have to keep a list of addresses that needs to be constantly updated.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\nIn this example, `afraid.org` DDNS provider will be used.  \n1. First, create an account in a DDNS service provider like [freedns.afraid.org](https://freedns.afraid.org/) or other. Go to the site, click on the **Sign up Free** button and follow the registration instructions.  \n> **Image:** Making an account  \n> **TIP:** NOTE  \nActivate the accounts from the link sent in their e-mail.  \n2. After successful registration and activation, log in and navigate to the **Subdomains** menu.  \n> **Image:** Subdomains menu  \n3. Proceed by clicking on **Add a subdomain**.  \n> **Image:** Adding a subdomain  \nIn the **Add a new subdomain** menu, you must type the following information:  \n- **Type** \u2013 The type of the subdomain. More information about each type can be found in the **explanation** button (in this example, it will be left as default).\n- **Subdomain** \u2013 The name of the subdomain.\n- **Domain** \u2013 From the drop-down menu, choose a preferred domain (in this example, it will be left as default).\n- **Destination** \u2013 The dynamic IP of the gateway.\n- **TTL** (only for premium accounts) - A value for the period of time that a packet or data should exist on a computer or network before being discarded.\n- **Enable/disable Wildcard** \u2013 More information about the Wildcard can be found in the button **more info.**  \n4. After filling in all the required information, type the verification image in the field and click on **Save!**. You will be redirected to the page of registered subdomains.  \n> **Image:** List of Registered Subdomains  \n5. To configure the gateway, the user needs to navigate to **Services -> Dynamic DNS (Beta)** tab in the Web UI. In the **Overview** menu, they should type a name for the configuration and click on the **Add** button.  \n> **Image:** Adding a DDNS Configuration  \n6. This will redirect them to the configuration menu.  \n> **Image:** Configuration Menu  \n7. First, you must enable the service by click on the **Enable** button in the **Basic Settings**. Then fill in the required information:  \n- **Lookup Hostname** \u2013 The hostname of the DDNS provider (in this example \u2013 afraid.org).\n- **IP address version** \u2013 The version of the IP address (in this example, it will be left as default).\n- **DDNS Service provider [IPv4/IPv6]** \u2013 From the drop-down menu, then choose which DDNS provider you are using (in this example \u2013 afraid.org-basicauth).\n- **Hostname/Domain** \u2013 Fill in the subdomain name.\n- **Username** \u2013 The name used to register the DDNS account.\n- **Password** \u2013 The password of the DDNS account.  \n7. In the **Advanced Settings** tab, you can configure the details for the selected Dynamic DNS.  \n8. Configure also the gateway to check its IP. To do this, from the drop-down **IP address source [IPv4/IPv6]** menu, you need to choose **URL**. The gateway will fill in the **URL to detect [IPv4/IPv6]** field automatically. Change the link to another desirable page that reads the gateway\u2019s IP, but it is not necessary. The IP assigned to the gateway is read and sent to the DDNS provider.  \n9. In the **Event Network** **[IPv4/IPv6]** drop-down menu, choose the Network in which the DDNS-updater scripts will be started.  \nThe other fields are optional and will be left as default. The **Log to syslog** drop-down menu selects the level of the system logs. The **Log to file** button will allow syslogs to be saved in a file on the gateway\u2019s SD card.  \n> **Image:** Advanced Settings Tab  \n10.  In the **Timer Settings** tab, you can configure the details for the timer to check for changes of IP and errors.  \n> **Image:** Timer Settings Tab  \n- **Check Interval** \u2013 The interval to check if there is a change of the IP for the gateway.\n- **Force Interval** \u2013 The interval to force updates to be sent to the DDNS provider.\n- **Error Retry Counter** \u2013 How many errors are allowed to occur before the script stops.\n- **Error Retry Interval** \u2013 The interval after which the script will start running again after an error.  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\nFor this example, Timer Settings will be left as default.  \n11.  In the **Log File Viewer** tab, you can view the system logs, and it is helpful in the case of debugging. To see the logs, click on **Read / Reread log file.**  \n> **Image:** Log File Viewer Tab  \n12.  To save the settings, click **Save & Apply.**  \n13.  If everything is configured correctly, the user will be able to access the gateway via the name of the subdomain in the list of the added subdomains in the DDNS provider.  \n> **Image:** Name of the Subdomain  \n> **Image:** Accessing the Gateway via the Domain Name"}
