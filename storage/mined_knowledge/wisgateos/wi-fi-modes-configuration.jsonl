The green arrows ![13.a](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/subdocument1/13.a.png) right to the field will show/hide the password.  \nBelow the **Wireless Client** menu, you can see the **Status** of the mode and select what protocol to use. You can choose between **Static address** or **DHCP client**.  \nIn the **DHCP mode**, there is not much to configure. The DHCP server of the router will set an IP for the gateway. You can enable/disable the **Use DNS servers advertised by peer** button. If the button is unchecked, the advertised DNS server addresses are going to be ignored. Optionally, you can override the MTU.  \n> **Image:** DHCP Client Protocol  \nIf you chooses the Static address protocol, it can set a static IP address for the gateway. This way, after a reboot or restart of the router, the gateway will keep the assigned IP address.  \nTo do so, you must type the IP of the network in the **IPv4 address** field (or the **IPv6 address** one if that version is used). In the **IPv4 netmask** field (or in **IPv6 routed prefix**), you must type the subnet mask (prefix for IPv6) of the IP address. For example the netmask for 192.168.0.128 is 255.255.255.0.  \nIn the **IPv4 gateway** (or **IPv6 gateway**) field, you must type the IP that will be assigned to the gateway.  \nAdditionally, you can use custom DNS servers via the **Use custom DNS servers** field. You can add more than one server with the list button ![13.c](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/subdocument1/13.c.png).  \nIn the **Override MTU** field,  you can set a size for the largest packet or frame that can be sent over the network. The MTU of an Ethernet connection is 1500 bytes.  \n> **Image:** Static Address Protocol"}
