The guide is not about how to install ChirpStack, but how to configure the gateway to send data to it. In this tutorial, an external ChirpStack v4 Network Server is used as an example.  \nFor external ChirpStack, RAK provides instructions for installing the ChirpStack Network Server on the AWS cloud. You can refer to the [Learn Site](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN/#installing-chirpstack))."}
