Download the source code and open it with Arduino IDE.\n\n- [Example source code for RAK3244 BastWAN](https://github.com/RAKWireless/Evaluation_Boards/tree/master/RAK4260/Arduino/send-class-A-OTAA)\n\nThe following sections will demonstrate how to modify LoRaWAN parameters to establish a connection with The Things Network (TTN).\n\n### Modify LoRaWAN Parameters\n\nFor the RAK3244 BastWAN to successfully connect to a LoRaWAN Platform, several parameters must be properly configured. Not doing so will result in connection failure.\n\nThe most volatile parameters on LoRaWAN configuration are the Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Keys. These data must match with the ones on The Thing Network (TTN) platform. Copy the EUIs and Keys from the TTN platform and paste them on the sample source code. **Figure 17** shows the lines of codes that should be modified:\n\n> **Image:** Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Keys\n\n### Compile and Flash the Firmware\n\nNow that the LoRaWAN parameters are set, run the sample program.\n\nClick the **Verify** button on the upper left of Arduino IDE to compile the code. Before uploading the sample firmware, make sure that the RAK3244 BastWAN is connected and recognized by your PC. To verify this, there must be an assigned port on the **Tools** toolbar of Arduino IDE. It should not be grayed out.\n\n> **Image:** Compilation of sample source code\n\nIf everything is well, click the **Upload** button and the firmware should be flashed to your RAK3244 BastWAN.\n\n> **Image:** Upload the sample source code\n\nThe RAK3244 BastWAN will try to join the LoRaWAN network server, and if it is successful, it will send a string to verify its presence.
