From the protocol list, choose **LoRa Gateway MQTT Bridge**.\n3. Set status report interval.\n+ **Static Interval (s)**: Defines the interval (in seconds) at which the gateway sends **status reports** containing operational and packet processing statistics.\n4. Select MQTT bridge protocol:\n+ **MQTT for Built-in LoRa Network Server**: This option forwards packets from extender gateways to the central gateway in multi-gateway setups.\n+ **MQTT for ChirpStack 2.x**\n+ **MQTT for ChirpStack 3.x (JSON)**\n+ **MQTT for ChirpStack 3.x (Protobuf)**\n+ **MQTT for ChirpStack 4.x (Protobuf)**\n5. Enter MQTT Broker information.\n+ **MQTT Broker Address**: IP address of the **MQTT broker**.\n+ **MQTT Broker Port**: Default **1883**.\n+ **MQTT Version**: Choose between V3.1 and V3.1.1. There is very little difference between them, more information can be found on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.org/wiki/Differences-between-3.1.0-and-3.1.1).\n6. Configure message delivery options.\n+ **QoS (Quality of Service)**:\n+ **0 - At Most Once**\n+ **1 - At Least Once**\n+ **2 - Exactly Once**\n+ **Keepalive interval (s)**: Interval in seconds to keep the connection alive (default: `10`).\n+ **Clean Session**: When enabled, the broker does **not** store session data.\n+ **Retain**: If enabled, the last published message is **retained**.\n7. Enable authentication *(Optional)*.\n+ Toggle **Enable User Authentication** and enter a **username** and **password**.  \n8. Set security options *(Optional)*.\n+ **SSL/TLS Mode**: Configure secure connection\n+ **None**\n+ **CA signed server certification**\n+ **Self-signed server certification**\n+ **Self-signed server & client certification**\n+ **TLS Version**: Choose between **TLS v1.1** and **TLS v1.2**.  \n9. MQTT Topics.  \nThe following topics are predefined by the LNS specification and do not require manual configuration:  \n+ **Uplink Topic**\n+ **Downlink Topic**\n+ **Downlink Acknowledge Topic**\n+ **Gateway Statistic Topic**"}
