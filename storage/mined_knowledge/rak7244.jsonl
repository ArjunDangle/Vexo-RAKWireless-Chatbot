This unique capability allows for innovative network architectures to be implemented, that are advantageous over other short-range systems. The built-in RAK2013 Cellular Pi HAT in the RAK7244C is based on the EG95 from Quectel, which is an LTE CAT4 module optimized specifically for M2M and IoT Applications. The RAK7244P is particularly suitable for deployment in cases where there is existing networking infrastructure and PoE is provisioned.\n\nThe RAK7244 WisGate Developer D4 Gateway is ideal for prototyping, proof-of-concept demonstrations or evaluation of future deployment scenarios. It includes a ready to use Firmware based on Raspbian OS, that makes it possible to connect the Gateway to any standard LoRaWAN Server. It is developer friendly as the large Raspbian OS community is a well-established one. It is especially suited to addressing a variety of applications like Smart Grids, Intelligent Farms and other IoT Enterprise applications.\n\n### Features\n\n- Refreshed Case design with a new MCU (**Raspberry Pi4**)\n- Preassembled, fully functioning **LoRaWAN Gateway**\n- Full LoRaWAN Stack support (**version 1.0.2**)\n- Supports for **8 channels** and spreading factors (SF7-SF12)\n- Frequency band support: EU433, CN470, RU864, IN865, EU868, US915, AU915, KR920, AS923\n- Tx Power: **27 dBm Max**\n- RX Sensitivity: **-139dBm**\n- Integrates **Ublox MAX-7Q GPS** module\n- **Quectel EG95** LTE module (Optional with the RAK7244C model)\n- **PoE 802.3 af** support (Optional with the RAK7244P model)\n\n### Package Contents\n\n> **Image:** RAK7244/RAK7244P Package Contents\n\n> **Image:** RAK7244C Package Contents\n","keywords":[],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7244\\datasheet.md","token_count":0}

The RAK2245 is an essential part of any of the RAK7244 models as it provides all LoRaWAN connectivity. It receives and transmits LoRa Frames and takes care of modulating/demodulating the signals among others. The processing of the LoRa Frames as well as higher level protocol related tasks is done by the embedded host system (Raspberry Pi). Received and processed LoRa Frames are being sent to a LoRaWAN Server. The segmentation of protocol related tasks is outside the scope of this document.\n\n> **Image:** RAK7244 System Structure\n\n##### RAK7244P\n\nThe figure below summarizes the basic building blocks of RAK7244P.

To learn more, refer to the ChirpStack [site](https://www.chirpstack.io/).\n\nWhen it comes to RAK7244 WisGate Developer D4 Gateway, there are two (2) ways to use the ChirpStack:\n\n### Using the Built-In ChirpStack\n\nThere is a built-in ChirpStack in every RAK Developer gateway if you use the latest firmware or the `rak_common_for_gateway` repository.\n\n- When you use it for the first time after burning the latest firmware, the gateway will work in the **EU868 Band**, and it will use the built-in ChirpStack as its default LoRa Server. If you don't want to change the frequency or LoRa Server, you don't have to do anything as this will be configured automatically when the gateway boots.\n\n- However, if it is not the first time you use the gateway and you want to use the built-in ChirpStack as the LoRa Server, follow the steps discussed in the [Configuring the Gateway](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7244/quickstart/#configuring-the-gateway) section.\n\n- **Optional** - If ever you disabled the **AP Mode** and you have connected it to your own Wi-Fi network **(Client Mode)**, you can search for your gateway’s IP Address via [Advanced IP Scanner](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/).\n\n- There is a **Web-based UI** that comes with the ChirpStack instance. Open a browser and enter the following credentials:\n\n    - **Browser Address**: `<Gateway IP address>:8080` (Example: `http://192.168.0.100:8080` )\n    - **Username**: admin\n    - **Password**: admin\n\n\n> **WARNING:** It is advisable to **change your password** to tighten the security of your account. You can change this by clicking the change password button at the user icon.\n\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack web-based UI\n\n- Everything should be pre-configured - **Device profiles** have been created, the gateway has been registered with the server, etc. If you go to the **Gateways tab** and click on **rak_gateway**, you should see the gateway details page.\n\n> **Image:** Available gateway in Chirpstack\n\n- Go to **Gateways** and see the **Last seen status**. It must be a few seconds ago, which signifies that the gateway is visible in the ChirpStack server.\n\n> **Image:** Last seen status\n\n### Using an Independent ChirpStack\n\nYou can setup an independent ChirpStack by yourself and can set a ChirpStack in AWS. Refer to the [AWS guide](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN). If you want to run ChirpStack on a different host/cloud, then refer to the [guide](https://www.chirpstack.io/guides/debian-ubuntu/) on the ChirpStack site.\n\n\n> **WARNING:** Remember to run the `sudo gateway-config` command in the CLI and point the gateway to the IP address of the machine you just installed ChirpStack on. This can be done in item 2 in the menu **Setup RAK Gateway LoRa concentrator**.\n\n\n- Assuming you have set it up correctly, log into your ChirpStack to register your gateway by opening the ChirpStack's web page in a browser by entering:\n\n    - **Browser Address**: `<IP Address of ChirpStack>:8080`\n    - **Username**: admin\n    - **Password**: admin\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack login page\n\n- Click **Gateways** and select **+ CREATE** to register your gateway.\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack registered gateways\n\n- After registering your gateway, fill in the necessary information.\n\n> **Image:** Filling in the details\n\n- Fill in the gateway ID you got from the [Configuring the Gateway](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7244/quickstart/#configuring-the-gateway) section, also called gateway EUI.\n\n- If you have properly configured your gateway and there is a network connection between the external ChirpStack and your gateway, you should see the same page and status, as shown in **Figure 12**.\n\n> **Image:** Successfully registered a gateway\n\nNow, you have successfully connected your gateway to an external ChirpStack.\n\n","keywords":["ChirpStack","LoRaWAN Network Server","RAK7244","WisGate Developer D4 Gateway","Built-In ChirpStack","Independent ChirpStack","Gateway Configuration"],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7244\\lorawan-network-server-guide.md","token_count":0}
