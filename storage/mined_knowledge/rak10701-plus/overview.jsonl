This enables:  \n<ul><li>Real-time metric calculation for both uplink and downlink (RSSI, SNR, packet loss, gateway info)</li><li>Exportable CSV reports</li><li>Heatmap visualization of signal metrics (RSSI, SNR)</li></ul>  \n> **TIP:** NOTE\nWithout the Extension, signal analysis is limited to basic downlink responses only (see **Work Modes** below).  \n4. **Data Viewing**\nDepending on your configuration, test results can be:  \n<ul><li>Realtime display directly on the device screen</li><li>Exported as structured CSV logs (with Extension)</li><li>Visualized as heatmaps (with Extension)</li><li>Sent to external application servers (with LNS integration)</li></ul>  \n**Work Modes**  \nField Tester Plus offers two operational modes, depending on whether the Field Test Data Processor Extension is installed and properly connected:  \n| Mode | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Field Tester Mode | Full-feature mode. The gateway runs the Field Test Data Processor Extension, which analyzes uplinks locally via MQTT and feeds results back to the device.Displays bothuplink and downlink metrics, includingRSSI, SNR, packet loss, distance (if GPS is available), and allowsCSV exportand heatmap generation. |\n| LinkCheck Mode | Basic mode. The device has joined an LNS, but no Extension is installed or configured.Only basic downlink information is shown:RSSI, SNR, andnumber of receiving gateways, based on LinkCheck MAC responses. No uplink metrics or CSV export is available. |"}
