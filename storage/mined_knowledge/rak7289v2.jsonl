Whether it is a local or external ChirpStack Network Server, the steps to add a gateway are the same. The guide is not about how to install ChirpStack, but how to configure the gateway to send data to it. In this tutorial, an external ChirpStack v4 Network Server is used as an example.\n\nFor external ChirpStack, RAK provides instructions for installing the ChirpStack Network Server on the AWS cloud. You can refer to the [Learn Site](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN/#installing-chirpstack)).\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Your RAK gateway is connected to the Internet.\n- Connect to ChirpStack v4, the firmware of gateway is WisGateOS 2 2.2.x or above.\n- ChirpStack v4 Network server is ready.\n\nTo access the ChirpStack web UI, you need to enable **TCP port 8080** and to make the gateway to communicate with the Network server you need to enable the following ports in the inbound rules of the instance:\n\n- The Semtech Packet Forwarder needs UDP port `1700`.\n- MQTT Bridge (unsecured) needs TCP port `1883`.\n- MQTT Bridge (secured) needs TCP port `8883`.\n- Basics Station needs TCP port `3001`.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nInstructions for opening the ports mentioned above are provided in the [installing ChirpStack on AWS](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN/#installing-chirpstack) guide.\n\n\n### Registering the Gateway\n\n1. To register the gateway in the ChirpStack Network server, access the ChirpStack UI. To do that, open a web browser and type the server address of the ChirpStack with port `8080`.\n\n```\n<IP address of ChirpStack>:8080\n```\n\n2. In this case, the ChirpStack is installed on the AWS cloud with the public IP address `18.156.176.220.`\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack login page\n\n3. Login using the following credentials:\n\n- Username/email: **admin**\n- Password: **admin**\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack dashboard\n\n4. On the left pane, head to **Gateways**.\n\n> **Image:** Gateway list\n\n5. By default, no gateways are registered. To register one, click **Add gateway**.\n6. In the **General** menu, you need to set the gateway parameters.\n\n> **Image:** Registering the gateway\n\n- **Name**: unique name for the gateway on the Network server. The name may only contain words, numbers, and dashes.\n- **Description**: a brief description of the gateway.\n- **Gateway ID (EUI64)**: the Extended Unique Identifier (EUI) of the gateway. The EUI is in the Overview menu of the Dashboard page of the web UI of the gateway.\n- **Stats interval (secs)**: The expected interval in seconds in which the gateway sends its statistics.\n\n7. Click **Submit**.

Start by accessing the gateway.\n\n> **Image:** Login page\n\n2. Login using the set credentials you have set in the [Access the Gateway](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7289v2/quickstart/#access-the-gateway) section.\n3. On the left side, head to **LoRa**. By default, the gateway is configured to work as **Built-in network server**.\n4. From **Work Mode**, select **Packet forwarder**. Click **Choose from the available protocols** to expand the Packet forwarder settings.\n\n> **Image:** Setting packet forwarder mode\n\n5. To use the built-in gateway bridge, from the **Protocol** select **LoRa Gateway MQTT Bridge**.\n\n> **Image:** LoRa Gateway MQTT bridge\n\n6. Choose **MQTT for ChirpStack 4.x (PROTOBUF)** as the MQTT protocol.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n+ The ChirpStack v3 supports both **MQTT for ChirpStack 3.x (JSON)** and **MQTT for ChirpStack 3.x (PROTOBUF)**. If you are using an earlier version of ChirpStack (v3), you need to choose one of the MQTT protocols to use.\n+ If you want to use the JSON protocol, you need to change the payload marshaler in the gateway bridge `.toml` file to `.json`. By default, the marshaler is protobuf. To configure the payload marshaler, you will use the SSH client PuTTY to access the configuration files. How to do this is explained in the [Learn Site](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN/#accessing-instance-via-ssh).\n\n\nBy default, the built-in gateway bridge is pointed to the local broker (127.0.0.1). To point the gateway to the ChirpStack network, you need to set the ChirpStack Broker address in the **MQTT Broker Address** field.\n\nIn this case, the ChirpStack is installed on an AWS cloud instance with public IP `18.156.176.220` (yours will be different). The default port that the MQTT Broker uses is 1883.\n\n> **Image:** Configure MQTT Bridge parameters on ChirpStack\n\n7. Click **Save changes** to save the changes.\n\nIf everything is set correctly, the gateway will display as online. You can click the gateway name to inspect the gateway traffic.\n\n> **Image:** Registered gateway\n\n> **Image:** Gateway details\n\n#### Connecting the Gateway via Basics Station\n\nIn this method, you will connect the gateway to the ChirpStack via Basics Station. The LoRa Basics™ Station is an implementation of a LoRa packet forwarder.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nWhen connecting the gateway to the ChirpStack, you will need to open TCP ports `3001` and `8080` to enable the communication between the gateway and the server and be able to access the ChirpStack.\n\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack enable ports\n\n1. Start by accessing the gateway.\n\n> **Image:** Login interface\n\n2. Login using the set credentials you have set in the [Access the Gateway](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7289v2/quickstart/#access-the-gateway) section.\n\n3. On the left side, head to **LoRa**. By default, the gateway is configured to work as **Built-in network server**.\n\n4. For **Work Mode**, select **Basics station** and click **Configure Basics Station** server setup to expand the Basics Station settings.\n\n> **Image:** Setting Basics Station mode\n\n- **Basics Station Server Type**: For server, choose LNS Server.\n- **Server URL**: the address of the ChirpStack v4 server. In this case, the ChirpStack v4 is installed on an AWS cloud instance with public IP `18.156.176.220` (yours will be different). The URL will be: `ws://18.156.176.220`.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThe URL starts with `ws://` in case a plain text connection is used. Using the `wss://` scheme will trigger a TLS connection based on the `tc.{cert,key,trust}`credentials set.\n\n\n- **Server Port**: the port to which the Websocket listens. The port is `3001`.\n- **Authentication Mode**: Authentication for the ChirpStack server. For this case, you will use no authentication.\n\n5. Click **Save changes** to save the changes.\n\nNow, your gateway is configured to work as a Basics Station and is pointed to the ChirpStack gateway bridge. The default installation of the ChirpStack sets up the backend of the ChirpStack gateway bridge as `semtech_udp`.\n\nTo configure the backend of the ChirpStack gateway bridge, you need to access the configuration file of the bridge. To access it, you will need an SSH terminal. In this case, you will use the PuTTY client.\n\nTo access the ChirpStack configuration files, you need to access the instance. How to do this is explained in the [Learn Site](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN/#accessing-instance-via-ssh).\n\n> **Image:** PuTTY client\n\n6. Go to the `/etc/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/` file path and open the `chirpstack-gateway-bridge.toml` file.\n\n7. In the file, find the gateway backend configuration paragraph and replace the type with `basic_station`.\n\n> **Image:** Configure gateway bridge type\n\n8. Now scroll down until you find the **Concentrator configuration** paragraph and uncomment the following text as shown below.\n\n> **Image:** Configuring gateway bridge backend\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThe example uses US915. The frequency band setting needs to be consistent with the frequency band of the gateway used.\n\n\n9. Save and exit the `.toml` file and restart the gateway bridge service to apply the changes by restarting the gateway bridge service with the following command:\n\n```text\nsudo systemctl restart chirpstack-gateway-bridge.service\n```\n\nNow, the ChirpStack backend configuration is set to the Basics station.\n\nIf everything is set correctly, the gateway will display as online. You can click the gateway name to inspect the gateway traffic.\n\n> **Image:** Registered gateway\n\n> **Image:** Gateway details\n","keywords":["ChirpStack","WisGateOS","Packet Forwarder","MQTT Bridge","Basics Station"],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7289v2\\lorawan-network-server-guide.md","token_count":0}

Otherwise, skip it.\n\n\n> **WARNING:** The SIM card slot of the cellular versions is not hot-swappable. Make sure the gateway is switched off before inserting or ejecting the SIM card.\n\n\n1.  Start by unscrewing the cap of the NanoSIM interface on the gateway enclosure to expose the SIM card slot.\n\n> **Image:** Unscrewing the cap of the NanoSIM interface\n\n2. Push the SIM card into the card slot according to the placement method marked on the interface.\n\n> **Image:** Inserting the SIM card\n\n3. Once completed, screw back the metal cap. Make sure it is tightly screwed.\n\n#### Mounting\n\n1. Fix the bracket included in the mounting kit on the bottom of the enclosure with four M6*12 screws.\n\n> **Image:** Mounting the bracket to the enclosure\n\n2. Position the pole clamps together around the pole, then tighten them with bolts, washers, and nuts.\n\n> **Image:** Mounting the clamps to a pole\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n\nThe diameter of the pole that is supported by the brackets is 50-100 mm. If the pole diameter is more than this value, hose clamps can be used. The standard mounting kit does not include hose clamps. If needed, they should be purchased separately.\n\nThe clamp's back also has openings for hose clamps that are not included in the mounting kit.\n\n\n> **Image:** Mounting using hose clamps\n\n3. Mount the enclosure and secure it to the bracket.\n\n   \n> **Image:** Fastening the enclosure to the bracket\n\n  - **Hang** the enclosure on the pre-installed mounting hook (①).\n  - Use the **adjustment screw** (②) to fine-tune the vertical angle of the gateway. This allows you to correct any tilt caused by the enclosure‘s draft angle or pole misalignment, ensuring that the antenna is perfectly vertical.\n  - Once the alignment is complete, **secure the enclosure** by tightening the two M6×12 screws (③).\n\n#### Attach the Antennas\n\nAttach the LoRa antenna(s). You need to attach one LoRa antenna for the 8-channel gateway, or two LoRa antennas for the 16-channel gateway.\n\n> **Image:** RAK7289V2/RAK7289CV2 with attached antennas\n\n#### Connect the PoE Adapter\n\nIf you choose to power the gateway via PoE or access the gateway and internet via the ETH port, you need to refer to this section. Otherwise, skip it.\n\nConnect one end of the Ethernet cable (Cat5e or better) to the **ETH(PoE)** port on the gateway and the other end to the **PoE** port of the PoE injector.\n\n### Weather Protection\n\nTo better protect the Ethernet cable gland and the antenna connector from the weather, you need to cover them with PVC tape.\n\n1. Clean the surface area of the connector that will be wrapped. Wrap a layer of PVC tape with a 50% overlap according to the rotation direction of the connector. Continue wrapping the PVC tape to about 10 mm below the end of the connector.\n\n> **Image:** Wrapping with PVC tape\n\n2. Cut off about 50 cm waterproof tape. Stretch it to double the length. Wrap three layers around the connector with a 50% overlap. Hold the tape in place with your hand for a few seconds.\n\n> **Image:** Wrapping with waterproof tape\n\n3. Wrap three additional layers with PVC tape with natural uncoiling force and a 50% overlap. Ensure to cover the head and the tail of the connector.\n\n> **Image:** Final PVC wrapping\n\n### Lightning Protection\n\nThis section covers the installation of the lightning surge protection system when deploying the RAK7289V2/RAK2789CV2 gateway, both outdoors and indoors. Such a protection system must be taken into consideration to ensure a fully functional gateway without interruptions or damage from lightning..\n\n> **Image:** Full lightning protection set-up\n\n#### Outdoor Surge Protection System\n\n- **Antenna Grounding**: RAKwireless recommends installing a lightning arrestor on all the antenna N-type terminals. The arrestors must be N-type Female to Male to fit the antenna and enclosure connectors. Ensure you use a 10 AWG or better wire to connect the screw terminals of the arrestors to the grounding rail mounted on the building wall (grounding bar in the case of field deployment).\n- **Gateway Grounding**: Additionally, it is recommended to use another 10 AWG or better grounding wire to connect the screw terminal on the bottom-left side of the gateway casing to the grounding rail (bar).\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nNo additional protection for the Ethernet cabling is required on the gateway side. It already has a built-in surge protection system (GDT + Anti-surge resistor).\n\n\n#### Indoor Surge Protection\n\nFor protecting the indoor equipment and circuitry connected to the gateway, it is recommended to install an Ethernet port SPD lightning arrestor. This device should be positioned along the cabling that connects the gateway to the PoE injector. Make sure you connect its grounding wire terminal to an appropriate building grounding point.\n\n\n> **WARNING:** Should you fail to adhere to the recommendations in this document, RAKwireless carries no responsibility for any damage your equipment incurs due to a lightning strike.\n\n\n#### Recommended Equipment\n\n- [Lightning Arrestor for the LoRa Antennas](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/lightning-arrestor): This surge protective device safeguards transceivers against over-voltage and surge current induced by lightning strikes.
