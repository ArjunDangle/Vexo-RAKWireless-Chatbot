Navigate to **LoRa > Applications** tab.\n\n> **Image:** Application list\n\n2. In the application list, click the newly created application and enter the **End devices** tab.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nIf you have enabled **Auto Add Device**, the device will be automatically registered with the adding request. Otherwise, you need to refer to the next step.\n\n\n \n> **Image:** Device list\n\n3. Click the **Add end device** button.\n4. In the **End device information** interface, enter the following information.\n\n \n> **Image:** Add new device\n\n+ **Activation Mode**: OTAA or ABP. This value needs to be consistent with the value from the end device. The ABP mode will pop up two additional fields, **Application Session Key** and **Network Session Key**.\n+ **End device (group) name**: Name of the end device (group).\n+ **End device description (optional)**: A description of the end device, optional.\n+ **Class**: This value needs to be consistent with the value from the end device.\n+ **Frame Counter Width**: Keep the default value.\n\n5. Click **Add end devices** to enter the device adding page.\n6. In the **Adding end devices** interface, enter the device EUI in the **End Device EUI (main)** field and click the **Add to End Devices list** button.\n\n \n> **Image:** Add new device to End Devices list\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n\n+ The device EUI needs to be consistent with the end device EUI.\n+ If the EUI is correct, the device will appear in the “End devices list”.\n+ If the EUI is duplicate, the device will be displayed in the “End devices with an error”.\n\n\n7. Click **Add end devices** to add the device to the application. Execute join request on the node side.\n\n> **Image:** Device online\n\nBy following the steps in the previous sections, you should now have your device registered. If you click on the **Device EUI**, you will go to the corresponding **Configuration** tab. Click the **Packet capture** button. Here you can monitor the data that the application is exchanging in real time.\n\n> **Image:** End Device Packet Capture\n","keywords":[],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7267\\lorawan-network-server-guide.md","token_count":0}

Make sure the gateway is switched off before inserting or ejecting the SIM card.\n\n\n#### Insert SIM Card\n\n1. Start by unscrewing the cap of the NanoSIM interface on the gateway Unify enclosure to expose the SIM card slot.\n\n> **Image:** SIM card slot\n\n2. Push the SIM card into the card slot according to the placement method marked on the interface.\n\n> **Image:** Inserting the SIM card\n\n3. Once completed, screw back the metal cap. Make sure it is tightly screwed.\n\n#### Mounting\n\nThis section provides the instructions on mounting and securing the mounting kit to the enclosure and the mounting pole.\n\n1. Fix the pole mounts marked with the letter A on the gateway Unify enclosure using four (4) pieces of M3 x 8 mm head screw with a washer. The fixed positions are shown in **Figure 5**.\n\n> **Image:** Pole mounts marked with the letter A\n\n> **Image:** Fixing the pole mounts on the enclosure\n\n2. After fixing the mounts on the enclosure, place the Unify Enclosure onto the pole by using two (2) steel strips (65\\~89 mm).\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n\nThe steel strips **ONLY** support 65\\~89 mm diameter pole.\n\n\n> **Image:** Fixing the enclosure on the pole\n\n### Lightning Protection\n\nThis section covers the installation of the lightning surge protection system when deploying the RAK7267 gateway outdoors. Such a protection system must be taken into consideration to ensure a fully functional gateway without interruptions or damage from lightning..\n\n**Gateway Grounding**: It is recommended to use another 10 AWG or better grounding wire to connect the screw terminal on the bottom side of the gateway casing to the grounding rail (bar).\n\n### Power On the Gateway\n\nIn this section, it is assumed that you have read and performed the procedures listed in the **Installation** part of this document.\n\nThe gateway supports multiple power supply options. Connect the gateway to the appropriate power source based on the power cables included in the bundle you purchased.\n\n**Cable and Power Adapter:** When the gateway is deployed indoors, it is recommended to use the cable and power adapter to power the gateway.\n\n> **Image:** Powering the gateway through a DC adapter\n\n**DC Cable:** If you use a customized external DC power supply to power the gateway, you need to use the DC cable to connect the external power supply. The external power supply voltage range:  9~36 V<sub>DC</sub>.\n\n> **Image:** Powering the gateway through an external DC power source\n\n**Cable for RAK9155 Battery Plus**: For outdoor deployment scenarios, it is recommended to use RAK9155 Battery Plus as its power supply. This cable is dedicated to the RAK9155 Battery Plus.\n\n> **Image:** Powering the gateway through RAK Battery Plus\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n[RAK9155 Battery Plus](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak-battery-plus-rak9155?variant=42309251563718) is not included in the bundle, it needs to be purchased separately.\n\n\n### Access the Gateway\n\nFor RAK7267, you need to access the gateway through Wi-Fi AP Mode. You can find an SSID, named **RAK7267_XXXX** on your PC's Wi-Fi network list. **XXXX** is the last two bytes of the gateway's MAC address.\n\n1. To access the Web Management Platform, input the following IP Address in your Web browser: `192.168.230.1`.\n\n   \n> **TIP:** NOTE\n\n   No password is required to connect via Wi-Fi.\n\n\n> **Image:** Accessing the gateway via Wi-Fi AP mode\n\n2. For security reasons, upon the first login, you must set a login password. To do this, enter the desired password and confirm it in the provided fields. The password must meet the following requirements:\n\n- At least 12 characters long\n- Has at least one special character (`!“#$%&\\‘()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_{|}~`)\n- Has at least one number\n- Has at least one standard Latin letter (used in the English alphabet)\n\n> **Image:** Web UI login page\n\n3. When the fields are filled in, click the **Set password** button to apply it. The web UI is now accessible and it will load the **LoRaWAN Statistics page**.\n\n> **Image:** LoRaWAN statistics page\n\n4. On the next log in, you need to use the set password for access. The default login username is **root**.\n\n> **Image:** Login Page with set password\n\n### Access the Internet\n\nIn this section, two methods of accessing the internet are provided to give you different alternatives to choose from, depending on the availability of the necessary requirements.\n\n#### Connect Through Wi-Fi\n\n> **Image:** Accessing the Internet using Wi-Fi\n\n1. Access the gateway's Web UI, and navigate to **Network** > **WAN** > **Wi-Fi**.\n\n2. Expand the Wi-Fi block and click on **Settings**. Make sure the **Interface** is enabled.\n\n3. Click the **Scan** button to select your **ESSID**, or manually enter the ESSID of the network by clicking **Enter network (E)SSID manually**.\n\n4. Choose the correct **Encryption** method and enter the appropriate **Key**.\n\n   \n> **TIP:** NOTE\n   Assuming you have entered the correct parameter values, you should receive an IP address assigned by your Wi-Fi router's (AP) built-in DHCP server. You can use this new IP address to log in via a web browser (the same way as in AP mode).\n\n\n   \n> **Image:** Wi-Fi settings\n\nFor additional information, check the [WisGateOS 2 User Manual > WAN > Wi-Fi](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/software-apis-and-libraries/wisgateos2/overview/#wi-fi).\n\n#### Connect Through Cellular\n\nAfter inserting the SIM card, the gateway will automatically attempt to connect to the cellular network.\n\n1. If manual APN configuration is needed, go to **Network** > **WAN** > **Cellular** in the Web UI.\n\n2. Expand the **Cellular** section and click on **Settings**.\n\n   \n> **Image:** Cellular Interface Page\n\n3. For parameter configuration, refer to the [WisGateOS 2 User Manual > WAN > Cellular ](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/software-apis-and-libraries/wisgateos2/overview/#cellular).\n\n   \n> **Image:** Cellular settings\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nMake sure that your SIM card is activated and supports data services.\n\n","keywords":[],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7267\\quickstart.md","token_count":0}
