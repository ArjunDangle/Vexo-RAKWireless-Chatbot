A key component is the RAK2287, which provides LoRaWAN connectivity. It handles the transmission and reception of LoRa Frames, as well as signal modulation and demodulation. \n\nHigher-level protocol tasks and the processing of LoRa Frames are managed by the embedded host system (Raspberry Pi). Processed LoRa Frames are then forwarded to a LoRaWAN Server. The segmentation of protocol-related tasks is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n> **Image:** RAK7394 System Structure\n\n> **Image:** RAK7394C System Structure\n\n> **Image:** RAK7394P System Structure\n\n#### Block Diagram\n\nThe RAK7394 serves as the central hardware solution for all LoRa-based radio communication. It handles the transmission and reception of radio messages, while the processing of these messages and protocol-related tasks is performed by the embedded host system (Raspberry Pi 4). Processed radio messages are forwarded to a LoRaWAN server. The block diagram of the RAK7394 is illustrated in **Figure 4**.\n\n> **Image:** RAK7394C Block Diagram\n\n##### RAK9003 Pi HAT\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThe specific segmentation of protocol-related tasks is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\n> **Image:** RPi to RAK9003\n\n##### RAK2013 Cellular Pi HAT\n\nThe **RAK2013 Cellular Pi HAT** is an add-on board designed according to the Raspberry Pi HAT standard.

For more information, visit the [ChirpStack site](https://www.chirpstack.io/).\n\nFor the RAK7394/RAK7394C/RAK7394P WisGate Developer CM4 Gateway, there are two ways to use ChirpStack:\n\n### Using the Built-in ChirpStack\n\nThere is a built-in ChirpStack in every RAK Developer gateway if you use the latest firmware or the `rak_common_for_gateway` repository.\n\n- When using the gateway for the first time after burning the latest firmware, it will operate in the **EU868 Band** and use the built-in ChirpStack as its default LoRa Server. If you do not wish to change the frequency or LoRa Server, no additional configuration is required, as this setup is automatically applied when the gateway boots.\n\n- If it is not your first time using the gateway and you want to use the built-in ChirpStack as the LoRa Server, follow the steps outlined in the **Configuring the Gateway** section.\n\n- **Optional**: If you have disabled **AP Mode** and connected the gateway to your Wi-Fi network (**Client Mode**), you can locate your gateway’s IP address using tools like [Advanced IP Scanner](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/).\n\n- The ChirpStack instance includes a **Web-based UI**. To access it, open a browser and use the following credentials:\n\n  - **Browser Address**: `<Gateway IP address>:8080` (Example: `http://192.168.0.100:8080`)\n  - **Username**: `admin`\n  - **Password**: `admin`\n\n\n> **WARNING:** It is recommended to **change your password** to enhance the security of your account. You can do this by clicking the **Change Password** option under the user icon.\n\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack web-based UI\n\n- Everything is pre-configured, including **Device Profiles**, and the gateway is already registered with the server. To view the details, go to the **Gateways** tab and click on **rak_gateway** to access the gateway details page.\n\n> **Image:** Available gateway in Chirpstack\n\n- Navigate to the **Gateways** tab and check the **Last seen** status. It should show as a few seconds ago, indicating that the gateway is visible to the ChirpStack server.\n\n> **Image:** Last seen status\n\n### Using an Independent ChirpStack\n\nYou can set up an independent ChirpStack instance or deploy one on AWS. For instructions on using ChirpStack with AWS, refer to the [AWS guide](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN/). If you prefer to run ChirpStack on a different host or cloud service, follow the [Debian/Ubuntu guide](https://www.chirpstack.io/guides/debian-ubuntu/) on the ChirpStack site.\n\n\n> **WARNING:** Run the `sudo gateway-config` command in the CLI and configure the gateway to point to the IP address of the machine where you installed ChirpStack. This can be done by selecting **Setup RAK Gateway LoRa concentrator** (item 2 in the menu).\n\n\n- Assuming the setup is correct, log in to your ChirpStack instance to register your gateway by opening ChirpStack's web page in a browser and entering the appropriate URL.\n\n    - **Browser Address**: `<IP Address of ChirpStack>:8080`\n    - **Username**: `admin`\n    - **Password**: `admin`\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack login page\n\n- Click **Gateways** and select **+ CREATE** to register your gateway\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack registered gateways\n\n- Fill in the necessary information.\n\n> **Image:** Fill in the details\n\n- Fill in the gateway ID that you got from the **Configuring the Gateway** section, also called gateway EUI.\n\n- If your gateway is properly configured and a network connection is established between the external ChirpStack and your gateway, you should see the same page and status as depicted in **Figure 12**.\n\n> **Image:** Successfully registered a gateway\n","keywords":["ChirpStack","LoRaWAN","Gateway","RAK7394","Configuration"],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7394\\lorawan-network-server-guide.md","token_count":0}
