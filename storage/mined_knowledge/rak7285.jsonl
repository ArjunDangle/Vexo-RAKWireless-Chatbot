Whether it is a local or external ChirpStack Network Server, the steps to add a gateway are the same. The guide is not about how to install ChirpStack, but how to configure the gateway to send data to it. In this tutorial, an external ChirpStack v4 Network Server is used as an example.\n\nFor external ChirpStack, RAK provides instructions for installing the ChirpStack Network server on AWS cloud. You can refer to the [Learn Site](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN).\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Your RAK gateway is connected to the Internet.\n- Connect to ChirpStack v4, the firmware of gateway is WisGateOS 2 2.2.x or above.\n- ChirpStack v4 Network server is ready.\n\nTo access the ChirpStack web UI, you need to enable **TCP port 8080** and to make the gateway to communicate with the Network server you need to enable the following ports in the inbound rules of the instance:\n\n- The Semtech Packet Forwarder needs UDP port `1700`.\n- MQTT Bridge (unsecured) needs TCP port `1883`.\n- MQTT Bridge (secured) needs TCP port `8883`.\n- Basics Station needs TCP port `3001`.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n\nInstructions for opening the ports mentioned above are provided in the [installing ChirpStack on AWS](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN/#installing-chirpstack) guide.\n\n\n### Registering the Gateway\n\n1. To register the gateway in the ChirpStack Network server, access the ChirpStack UI. To do that, open a web browser and type the server address of the ChirpStack with port `8080`.\n\n```\n<IP address of ChirpStack>:8080\n```\n\n2. In this case, the ChirpStack is installed on the AWS cloud with the public IP address `18.156.176.220.`\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack login page\n\n3. Login using the following credentials:\n\n- Username/email: **admin**\n- Password: **admin**\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack dashboard\n\n4. On the left pane, head to **Gateways**.\n\n> **Image:** Gateway list\n\n5. By default, no gateways are registered. To register one, click **Add gateway**.\n6. In the **General** menu, you need to set the gateway parameters.\n\n> **Image:** Registering the gateway\n\n- **Name**: unique name for the gateway on the Network server. The name may only contain words, numbers, and dashes.\n- **Description**: a brief description of the gateway.\n- **Gateway ID (EUI64)**: the Extended Unique Identifier (EUI) of the gateway. The EUI is in the Overview menu of the Dashboard page of the web UI of the gateway.\n- **Stats interval (secs)**: The expected interval in seconds in which the gateway sends its statistics.\n\n7. Click **Submit**. You will see the registered gateway in the Gateway list.\n\n> **Image:** Registered gateway\n\n### Configuring the Gateway\n\nThree options will be considered here, and you can choose one of the connection options as needed.\n\n#### Connecting the Gateway via Packet Forwarder\n\nIn this method, you will configure the gateway’s packet forwarder to send data to the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nWhen connecting the gateway to the ChirpStack, you will need to open ports 1700 and 8080 to enable the communication between the gateway and the server and be able to access the ChirpStack.\n\n\n> **Image:** Opened 1700 UDP port\n\n1. Start by accessing the gateway.\n\n> **Image:** Login page\n\n2. Login using the set credentials you have set in the [Access the Gateway](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7285/quickstart/#access-the-gateway) section.\n3. On the left side, head to **LoRa**. By default, the gateway is configured to work as a Built-in network server.\n\n4. From **Work Mode**, select **Packet forwarder**. Click **Choose from the available protocols** to expand the Packet forwarder settings.\n\n> **Image:** Setting Packet Forwarder Mode\n\nWhen Packet Forwarder mode is chosen, the **Semtech UDP GWMP Protocol** is selected by default.\n\nIn this case, the ChirpStack is installed on the AWS cloud instance with public IP **18.156.176.220** (yours will be different). The default ports that the packet forwarder is using are 1700.\n\n> **Image:** Configuring Packet Forwarder to ChirpStack\n\n5. Click **Save changes** to save the changes.\n6. If everything is set correctly, the gateway will display as online. You can click the gateway name to inspect the gateway traffic.\n\n> **Image:** Registered gateway\n\n> **Image:** Gateway details\n\n#### Connecting the Gateway via MQTT Bridge\n\nIn this method, you will configure the gateway’s built-in bridge to publish the data to the ChirpStack MQTT broker.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nWhen connecting the gateway to the ChirpStack, you will need to open ports 1883 and 8080 to enable the communication between the gateway and the server and be able to access the ChirpStack.\n\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack enable ports\n\n1. Start by accessing the gateway.\n\n> **Image:** Login interface\n\n2. Login using the set credentials you have set in the [Access the Gateway](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7285/quickstart/#access-the-gateway) section.\n3. On the left side, head to **LoRa**. By default, the gateway is configured to work as **Built-in network server**.\n4. From **Work Mode**, select **Packet forwarder**. Click **Choose from the available protocols** to expand the Packet forwarder settings.\n\n> **Image:** Setting packet forwarder mode\n\n5. To use the built-in gateway bridge, from the **Protocol** select **LoRa Gateway MQTT Bridge**.\n\n> **Image:** LoRa Gateway MQTT bridge\n\n6. Choose **MQTT for ChirpStack 4.x (PROTOBUF)** as the MQTT protocol.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n+ The ChirpStack v3 supports both **MQTT for ChirpStack 3.x (JSON)** and **MQTT for ChirpStack 3.x (PROTOBUF)**. If you are using an earlier version of ChirpStack (v3), you need to choose one of the MQTT protocols to use.\n+ If you want to use the JSON protocol, you need to change the payload marshaler in the gateway bridge `.toml` file to `.json`. By default, the marshaler is protobuf. To configure the payload marshaler, you will use the SSH client PuTTY to access the configuration files. How to do this is explained in the [Learn Site](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN).\n\n\nBy default, the built-in gateway bridge is pointed to the local broker (127.0.0.1). To point the gateway to the ChirpStack network, you need to set the ChirpStack Broker address in the **MQTT Broker Address** field.\n\nIn this case, the ChirpStack is installed on an AWS cloud instance with public IP `18.156.176.220` (yours will be different). The default port that the MQTT Broker uses is 1883.\n\n> **Image:** Configuring packet forwarder to ChirpStack\n\n7. Click **Save changes** to save the changes.\n\nIf everything is set correctly, the gateway will display as online. You can click the gateway name to inspect the gateway traffic.\n\n> **Image:** Registered gateway\n\n> **Image:** Gateway details\n\n#### Connecting the Gateway via Basics Station\n\nIn this method, you will connect the gateway to the ChirpStack via Basics Station. The LoRa Basics™ Station is an implementation of a LoRa packet forwarder.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nWhen connecting the gateway to the ChirpStack, you will need to open TCP ports `3001` and `8080` to enable the communication between the gateway and the server and be able to access the ChirpStack.\n\n\n> **Image:** ChirpStack enable ports\n\n1. Start by accessing the gateway.\n\n> **Image:** Login page\n\n2. Login using the set credentials you have set in the [Access the Gateway](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/rak7285/quickstart/#access-the-gateway) section.\n\n3. On the left side, head to **LoRa**. By default, the gateway is configured to work as **Built-in network server**.\n\n4. For **Work Mode**, select **Basics station** and click **Configure Basics Station** server setup to expand the Basics Station settings.\n\n> **Image:** Configuring Basics Station to ChirpStack\n\n- **Basics Station Server Type**: For server, choose LNS Server.\n- **Server URL**: the address of the ChirpStack v4 server. In this case, the ChirpStack v4 is installed on an AWS cloud instance with public IP `18.156.176.220` (yours will be different). The URL will be: `ws://18.156.176.220`.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThe URL starts with `ws://` in case a plain text connection is used. Using the `wss://` scheme will trigger a TLS connection based on the `tc.{cert,key,trust}`credentials set.\n\n\n- **Server Port**: the port to which the Websocket listens. The port is `3001`.\n- **Authentication Mode**: Authentication for the ChirpStack server. For this case, you will use no authentication.\n\n5. Click **Save changes** to save the changes.\n\nNow, your gateway is configured to work as a Basics Station and is pointed to the ChirpStack gateway bridge. The default installation of the ChirpStack sets up the backend of the ChirpStack gateway bridge as `semtech_udp`.\n\nTo configure the backend of the ChirpStack gateway bridge, you need to access the configuration file of the bridge. To access it, you will need an SSH terminal. In this case, you will use the PuTTY client.\n\nTo access the ChirpStack configuration files, you need to access the instance. How to do this is explained in the [Learn Site](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26743884863767-How-To-Use-Amazon-Web-Services-with-LoRaWAN).\n\n> **Image:** PuTTY client\n\n6. Go to the `/etc/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/` file path and open the `chirpstack-gateway-bridge.toml` file.\n\n7. In the file, find the gateway backend configuration paragraph and replace the type with `basic_station`.\n\n> **Image:** Configure gateway bridge type\n\n8. Now scroll down until you find the **Concentrator configuration** paragraph and uncomment the following text as shown below.\n\n> **Image:** Configuring gateway bridge backend\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThe example uses US915. The frequency band setting needs to be consistent with the frequency band of the gateway used.\n\n\n9. Save and exit the `.toml` file and restart the gateway bridge service to apply the changes by restarting the gateway bridge service with the following command:\n\n```text\nsudo systemctl restart chirpstack-gateway-bridge.service\n```\n\nNow, the ChirpStack backend configuration is set to the Basics station.\n\nIf everything is set correctly, the gateway will display as online. You can click the gateway name to inspect the gateway traffic.\n\n> **Image:** Registered gateway\n\n> **Image:** Gateway details\n","keywords":["ChirpStack","WisGateOS","Packet Forwarder","MQTT Bridge","Basics Station"],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7285\\lorawan-network-server-guide.md","token_count":0}

Otherwise, skip it.\n\n\n> **WARNING:** The SIM card slot of the cellular versions is not hot-swappable. Make sure the gateway is switched off before inserting or ejecting the SIM card.\n\n\n1. Start by unscrewing the cap of the NanoSIM interface on the gateway enclosure to expose the SIM card slot.\n\n> **Image:** Unscrewing the cap of the NanoSIM interface\n\n2. Push the SIM card into the card slot according to the placement method marked on the interface.\n\n> **Image:** Inserting the NanoSIM card\n\n3. Once completed, screw back the metal cap. Make sure it is tightly screwed.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThis section provides instructions on how to mount and secure the mounting kit to the enclosure and the mounting pole.\n\n1. Attach the mount adapter included in the mounting kit on the bottom of the enclosure using four M6 x 12 mm screws.\n\n> **Image:** Attaching the mount adapter to the enclosure\n\n2. After attaching the mount adapter, fix the device bracket on it with four M6*12 screws.\n\n> **Image:** Mounting the device bracket to the enclosure\n\n3. Position and fasten the pole clamps together around the pole with bolts, washers, and nuts.\n\n> **Image:** Mounting the clamps to a pole\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n\nThe pole supported by the brackets has a diameter ranging from 50~100 mm. If the pole diameter exceeds 100 mm, you can use steel strips instead. The standard mounting kit does not include steel strips, they are sold separately.\n\n\n> **Image:** Mounting using steel strips\n\n4. Hang up the enclosure and affix it with two M6*12 screws.\n\n> **Image:** Fastening the enclosure to the bracket\n\n#### Attach the Antennas\n\nAttach the LoRa, Wi-Fi, and GPS antennas. If you choose the LTE variant, you also need to attach the LTE antennas.\n\n> **Image:** RAK7285/RAK7285C with attached antennas\n\n#### Connect the PoE Adapter\n\nIf you choose to power the gateway via PoE or access the gateway and internet via the ETH port, you need to refer to this section. Otherwise, skip it.\n\nConnect one end of the Ethernet cable (Cat5e or better) to the **ETH(PoE)** port on the gateway and the other end to the **PoE** port of the PoE injector.\n\n### Weather Protection\n\nTo better protect the Ethernet cable gland and the antenna connector from the weather, you need to cover them with PVC tape.\n\n1. Clean the surface area of the connector that will be wrapped. Wrap a layer of PVC tape with a 50% overlap according to the rotation direction of the connector. Continue wrapping the PVC tape to about 10 mm below the end of the connector.\n\n> **Image:** Wrapping with PVC tape\n\n2. Cut off about 50 cm waterproof tape. Stretch it to double its length and wrap three layers around the connector with a 50% overlap. Hold the tape in place with your hand for a few seconds.\n\n> **Image:** Wrapping with waterproof tape\n\n3. Wrap three additional layers with PVC tape with natural uncoiling force and a 50% overlap. Ensure to cover the head and the tail of the connector.\n\n> **Image:** Final PVC wrapping\n\n### Lightning Protection\n\nThis section covers the installation of the lightning surge protection system when deploying the RAK7285/RAK7285C  gateway, both outdoors and indoors. Such a protection system must be taken into consideration to ensure a fully functional gateway without interruptions or damage from lightning.\n\n> **Image:** Full lightning protection set-up\n\n#### Outdoor Surge Protection System\n\n- **Antenna Grounding**: RAKwireless recommends installing a lightning arrestor on all the antenna N-type terminals. The arrestors must be N-type Female to Male to fit the antenna and enclosure connectors. Ensure you use a 10 AWG or better wire to connect the screw terminals of the arrestors to the grounding rail mounted on the building wall (grounding bar in the case of field deployment).\n- **Gateway Grounding**: Additionally, it is recommended to use another 10 AWG or better grounding wire to connect the screw terminal on the right side of the gateway casing to the grounding rail (bar).\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\n\n+ No additional protection for the Ethernet cabling is required on the gateway side. It already has a built-in surge protection system (GDT + Anti-surge resistor).\n\n+ No additional protection is required for the LoRa antennas. The cavity diplexer integrated into the LoRa antenna ports provides surge protection for the LoRa antennas.\n\n\n#### Indoor Surge Protection\n\nFor protecting the indoor equipment and circuitry connected to the gateway, it is recommended to install an Ethernet port SPD lightning arrestor. This device should be positioned along the cabling that connects the gateway to the PoE injector. Make sure you connect its grounding wire terminal to an appropriate building grounding point.\n\n\n> **WARNING:** Should you fail to adhere to the recommendations in this document, RAKwireless carries no responsibility for any damage your equipment incurs due to a lightning strike.\n\n\n#### Recommended Equipment\n\n- [Lightning Arrestor for GPS Antenna](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/lightning-arrestor-for-gps-antenna): This lightning arrestor connects the antenna to the GPS receiver. It is a surge protection device that secures the transceiver against transients, over-voltage, and surge currents induced by lightning bolts.

To access the Web Management Platform, input the following IP Address in your Web browser: `192.168.230.1`\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nNo password is required to connect via Wi-Fi.\n\n\n> **Image:** Accessing the gateway via Wi-Fi AP Mode\n\n2. For security reasons, upon the first login, you must set a login password. To do this, enter the desired password and confirm it in the provided fields. The password must meet the following requirements:\n\n- At least 12 characters long\n- Has at least one special character (`!“#$%&\\‘()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_{|}~`)\n- Has at least one number\n- Has at least one standard Latin letter (used in the English alphabet)\n\n> **Image:** Web UI login page\n\n3. When the fields are filled in, click the **Set password** button to apply it. The web UI is now accessible and it will load the **LoRaWAN Statistics page**.\n\n> **Image:** LoRaWAN statistics page\n\n4. On the next log in, you need to use the set password for access. The default login username is **root**.\n\n> **Image:** Login page with set password\n\n#### WAN Port (Ethernet)\n\nTo access the gateway through the ETH (PoE) port, make sure you have completed the steps defined in the [Connect the PoE Adapter](#connect-the-poe-adapter) section.\n\n1. Connect one end of another Ethernet cable to the LAN port on the PoE adapter, and the other end to your PC.\n\n> **Image:** Accessing the gateway via WAN Port (Ethernet)\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nThe default IP is **169.254.X.X**. The last two segments(X.X) are mapped from the last four bits of the MAC address of your gateway. For example, the last four bits of the MAC address are `0F:01`, and the IP address is `169.254.15.1`. Make sure to manually set the address of your PC to one in the same network (for example, `169.254.15.100`).\n\n\n2. Open the head to the **Ethernet Properties** and click the **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.\n\n> **Image:** Internet properties\n\n3. Select **Use the following IP address** and set the IP address (for example, `169.254.15.100`).\n\n> **Image:** Setting IP address of the PC\n\nIn this example, you can access the gateway on the `169.254.15.1` address.\n\n4. For security reasons, upon the first login, you must set a login password. To do this, enter the desired password and confirm it in the provided fields. The password must meet the following requirements:\n\n- At least 12 characters long\n- Has at least one special character (`!“#$%&\\‘()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_{|}~`)\n- Has at least one number\n- Has at least one standard Latin letter (used in the English alphabet)\n\n> **Image:** Web UI login page\n\n5. When the fields are filled in, click the **Set password** button to apply it. The Web UI is now accessible, and it will load the LoRaWAN Statistics page.\n\n> **Image:** LoRaWAN statistics page\n\n6. On the next log in, you need to use the set password for access. The default login username is **root**.\n\n> **Image:** Login Page with set password\n\n### Access the Internet\n\nIn this section, two methods of accessing the internet are provided to give you different alternatives to choose from, depending on the availability of the necessary requirements.\n\n#### Connect Through Wi-Fi\n\n1. Access the gateway's Web UI, and navigate to **Network** > **WAN** > **Wi-Fi**.\n2. Expand the Wi-Fi block and click on **Settings**. Make sure the **Interface** is enabled.\n\n> **Image:** Accessing the Internet using Wi-Fi\n\n- For additional information, check the [WisGateOS 2 User Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/software-apis-and-libraries/wisgateos2/overview).\n\n> **Image:** Wi-Fi settings\n\n3. You can either click the **Scan** button to choose your **ESSID** or manually type the ESSID of the network by clicking **enter network (E)SSID manually**.\n4. Select the right **Encryption** method and enter the correct **Key**.\n\n\n> **TIP:** NOTE\nAssuming you have entered the correct parameter values, you should receive an IP address assigned by your Wi-Fi router's (AP) built-in DHCP server. You can use this new IP address to log in via a web browser (the same way as in AP mode).\n\n\n#### Connect Through Ethernet/PoE\n\nTo access the Internet through the ETH (PoE) port, make sure you have completed the steps defined in the [Connect the PoE Adapter](#connect-the-poe-adapter) section.\n\n1. Connect one end of an Ethernet cable to the port labeled **ETH** on the gateway, and the other end to the PoE port of the PoE injector.\n\n> **Image:** Accessing the Internet through Ethernet\n\n2. Connect the LAN port of the PoE injector to your router. The router's DHCP server should assign an IP address to the gateway.\n\n3. Now, you can access the assigned IP to access the gateway. You can change the default settings below if you wish (details in the [WisGateOS 2 User Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/software-apis-and-libraries/wisgateos2/overview)).\n\n> **Image:** Connect through Ethernet settings\n","keywords":[],"source_file":"wisgate\\rak7285\\quickstart.md","token_count":0}
